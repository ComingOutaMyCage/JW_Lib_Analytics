00:00:01 Welcome!
00:00:03 This is my friend, Alex Reinmueller.
00:00:06 Alex is going to help me host our program,
00:00:09 which focuses on family.
00:00:13 Alex, what do we have to look forward to?
00:00:16 Thank you, Gerrit. I’m delighted to be here with you.
00:00:19 For nearly a decade,
00:00:21 children have enjoyed our animated series
00:00:24 Become Jehovah’s Friend.
00:00:26 How have they and their parents benefited?
00:00:29 As teens, Tainara and Alex developed
00:00:32 a strong identity as servants of Jehovah.
00:00:35 We’ll learn how this helped them resist temptations.
00:00:39 Are you married or contemplating marriage?
00:00:42 You’ll enjoy a new series we’re introducing in our program.
00:00:46 It’s designed to help Christian couples
00:00:48 achieve a happy marriage.
00:00:51 I’m eager to get started.
00:00:53 This is JW Broadcasting® for April 2022.
00:01:17 Today, we will talk about those
00:01:19 who are close to all of our hearts
00:01:23 —our children.
00:01:25 I am sure that you dear parents
00:01:27 greatly love and appreciate your children.
00:01:31 What a privilege it is to have them!
00:01:35 Think about it: There are millions of angels.
00:01:38 However, angels were not given the privilege to produce children.
00:01:44 When Jesus was on earth, he was not married,
00:01:47 so he did not have the privilege of having children.
00:01:51 But you parents have that privilege.
00:01:54 What a treasure!
00:01:58 What does the Governing Body want to tell you children?
00:02:01 That we love you!
00:02:04 We are so happy to have you with us,
00:02:07 and we would like to help you to become and remain
00:02:11 worshippers of Jehovah.
00:02:14 You are like a beautiful gift,
00:02:16 a special gift, from Jehovah.
00:02:19 Christian parents value and appreciate you children
00:02:22 more than a million dollars!
00:02:25 How do we know?
00:02:27 Because Psalm 127:3 says
00:02:32 that “[children] are an inheritance from Jehovah.”
00:02:37 What does that mean?
00:02:40 An inheritance is a very valuable gift
00:02:43 that has been given to someone.
00:02:46 Often, the gift is from an older family relative.
00:02:50 Jehovah views you children as a very valuable gift
00:02:55 that he has given to your parents.
00:02:58 He expects parents to take good care of this gift.
00:03:03 He entrusts parents with the welfare and happiness of their children.
00:03:10 And when parents do their best for you,
00:03:14 it especially makes us happy when you children
00:03:17 do your best to please and serve Jehovah.
00:03:22 There are so many children earth wide
00:03:24 who are fine examples for others
00:03:27 by means of their love for Jehovah and the truth.
00:03:32 Parents, will your children become good examples
00:03:36 for other young ones in the truth?
00:03:39 One father of seven children, all of whom grew up as lovers of Jehovah,
00:03:44 would always tell new parents
00:03:46 that there are no guarantees with children.
00:03:50 They each have their own personality
00:03:52 and are exposed to various outside influences.
00:03:57 But he would always urge new parents to do the best they can
00:04:01 to teach their children and reach their hearts.
00:04:05 Your conscientious effort increases the possibility
00:04:08 of them becoming a success in Jehovah’s service.
00:04:13 So parents, how are you caring
00:04:16 for your “inheritance”?
00:04:18 What are some vital steps
00:04:21 to teach and reach the heart of your child?
00:04:25 First, please locate
00:04:28 Judges 13:8.
00:04:33 The parents of Samson likely prayed often
00:04:36 for Jehovah’s help to properly raise their son.
00:04:41 Verse 8 says:
00:04:44 “Manoah pleaded with Jehovah and said: ‘Pardon me, Jehovah.
00:04:49 “‘Please let the man of the true God whom you just sent
00:04:53 “‘come again to instruct us
00:04:56 about what we should do with the child who will be born.’”
00:05:01 If you parents do the same,
00:05:03 Jehovah will answer your prayers through the Scriptures, Bible literature,
00:05:08 or possibly by means of a congregation meeting.
00:05:12 Additionally, being consistent with family worship
00:05:15 is vital to reach the heart of one’s child.
00:05:20 It is true that it takes some planning
00:05:22 and absorbs some of your time each week.
00:05:26 But remember that in 2008,
00:05:29 the Governing Body gave us all
00:05:31 the extra time each week for family worship
00:05:35 by adjusting the weekly meeting schedule.
00:05:39 A brother from Portugal wrote:
00:05:41 “Aside from family worship,
00:05:44 “my father had a separate Bible study on a different day
00:05:47 “with each of us three children.
00:05:50 “I am sure that these studies were very important
00:05:53 for us to resist all of the pressures at school.”
00:05:58 It is no surprise that all three children
00:06:01 have been in special full-time service for a number of years now.
00:06:07 Similarly, a brother from northern Italy wrote:
00:06:10 “We studied with each one of our children personally
00:06:14 in harmony with their age and gender.”
00:06:18 Each family head must decide what is best for his family.
00:06:23 However, a well-prepared Family Worship program
00:06:27 is essential.
00:06:30 Another excellent way to teach your children is by example.
00:06:35 Children often pick up mannerisms
00:06:38 from their parents.
00:06:40 They often walk and talk
00:06:42 like one of the parents.
00:06:44 But they also pick up on godly personality traits and attitudes.
00:06:49 So be the kind of person that you want your child to be.
00:06:54 Even though Jesus was the only perfect child ever born on earth,
00:06:59 it appears that his mother, Mary, and adoptive father, Joseph,
00:07:03 were good examples for him.
00:07:06 Luke 2:41, 42
00:07:10 tells us that Jesus’ parents “were accustomed to go from year to year
00:07:14 to Jerusalem for . . . the Passover.”
00:07:18 Joseph could have viewed the trip
00:07:20 as inconvenient and even too expensive.
00:07:24 But as parents, he and Mary set a good example
00:07:28 for the young boy Jesus.
00:07:31 Most young ones can quote
1 Corinthians 15:33 by heart.
00:07:37 Maybe it is because their parents have reminded them
00:07:40 of the principle so often.
00:07:43 “Bad associations spoil useful habits.”
00:07:49 Do you remember in Luke chapter 8 that Jesus spoke
00:07:53 about the different kinds of soil
00:07:55 that “the word of God” might fall on?
00:07:59 The “soil” represents your child’s heart.
00:08:02 It is our hope and prayer that your child’s heart
00:08:06 is like “good,” or “fine,” soil.
00:08:12 In verse 15,
00:08:14 Jesus applied the illustration of the fine soil,
00:08:18 saying:
00:08:19 “These are the ones who,
00:08:22 “after hearing the word with a fine and good heart,
00:08:25 retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”
00:08:29 But what can happen if after responding to your training from God’s Word,
00:08:34 your child is somehow exposed to bad association?
00:08:39 When young ones spend considerable time with other young ones
00:08:43 who have not been trained by Bible principles,
00:08:46 it can counteract your training from God’s Word.
00:08:50 Such association is like a severe rainstorm
00:08:54 that erodes the fine soil that you have built up.
00:08:59 It can quickly wash away the good training that you have given.
00:09:04 Psalm 1:1 says that we can be happy
00:09:08 if we do not “walk” with, “stand” with,
00:09:12 or “sit” with those who do what is bad.
00:09:16 And we could add to that
00:09:18 —and do not text or email others
00:09:22 who do not think wholesome thoughts.
00:09:25 Help your children to choose good associates.
00:09:30 So many young ones around the world
00:09:33 have responded to their parents’ fine instruction
00:09:36 and express themselves from the heart.
00:09:40 Let me share a few experiences that demonstrate this.
00:09:45 One young person from the United States wrote in saying:
00:09:50 “I am 11 years old,
00:09:52 “and I am an unbaptized publisher.
00:09:55 “I can’t thank you enough for all that you do!
00:09:58 “I especially appreciate all the time and effort you put
00:10:02 “into the Caleb and Sophia videos.
00:10:06 “I love these videos.
00:10:08 “They help me to show good conduct at school.
00:10:12 “I am grateful that you encourage family worship.
00:10:16 “You see, I used to have doubts about Jehovah.
00:10:20 “If it were not for the time at family worship,
00:10:23 “I probably would have drifted more and more.
00:10:27 “I love Jehovah and want to serve him,
00:10:31 “but I still have lots to work on.
00:10:34 “I hope you will make more videos to help me and other young ones
00:10:39 to serve Jehovah with our whole heart and whole soul.”
00:10:45 We received this message:
00:10:47 “Hi, I am ten years old.
00:10:51 “I just wanted to say thank you!
00:10:54 “When I grow up, I want to work in Bethel
00:10:56 “because I love Jehovah and want to make him happy.
00:11:01 “In Paradise, I want to open a zoo without cages.
00:11:05 Sending all my love!”
00:11:08 I recall I once met an eight-year-old girl in Denver, Colorado,
00:11:13 who was baptized at eight years of age.
00:11:16 By that time, she had read the entire Bible through twice.
00:11:22 Of course, each child is unique;
00:11:25 not all children become mature at the same rate
00:11:28 or at the same point in life.
00:11:30 You may recall that we read
00:11:32 Psalm 127:3 earlier,
00:11:36 which said that “[children] are an inheritance from Jehovah.”
00:11:42 Let’s read the next verse, number 4:
00:11:45 “Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
00:11:48 so are the sons of one’s youth.”
00:11:52 Children are likened to “arrows”
00:11:55 that should be aimed at a target.
00:11:58 An archer cannot recall an arrow once it leaves his bow.
00:12:02 Parents have “arrows.”
00:12:04 They have their children to aim at the target
00:12:08 for a relatively brief time.
00:12:11 And what is the target?
00:12:13 What is the goal?
00:12:15 For your children to become wholesome, dedicated,
00:12:19 and baptized servants of Jehovah.
00:12:24 However, arrows can be made from different materials,
00:12:28 and they can vary in size.
00:12:30 Parents must remember
00:12:32 that no two children are precisely alike.
00:12:36 Some have a good measure
00:12:38 of mental and emotional maturity at a young age
00:12:42 and express a desire to get baptized.
00:12:46 Others may not be ready for baptism until they are a bit older.
00:12:51 Thus, discerning parents
00:12:53 do not pressure their children to get baptized.
00:12:57 Rather, they assist each child
00:13:00 in keeping with his or her own growth and spiritual progress.
00:13:06 But it is also true that some parents
00:13:08 underestimate their children.
00:13:11 Some hold them back from dedicating their life to Jehovah,
00:13:16 even though they have developed
00:13:18 a close relationship with Him as a youngster.
00:13:23 We received this comment from a sister in Russia:
00:13:26 “Thank you very much for taking care of younger ones.
00:13:31 “I particularly appreciate your support.
00:13:34 “Your loving words inspire me.
00:13:37 “I am 17.
00:13:39 “I am invigorated by articles and videos
00:13:42 “which are prepared by you.
00:13:44 “Your work and love bring me to tears.
00:13:49 “Thank you very much!
00:13:52 “I am touched by your affectionate care of us here in Russia.
00:13:57 “Your warm words and prayers are the best comfort for us.
00:14:02 “I am grateful to you.
00:14:04 “Thanks to your taking care of me,
00:14:06 “I was able to begin pioneering two years ago.
00:14:09 “It’s the best life ever.
00:14:12 “I am happy.
00:14:14 “I can’t be silent.
00:14:16 I’m filled with gratitude.”
00:14:19 The Watchtower  once commented:
00:14:22 “It has been said that raising children is a 20-year project,
00:14:26 but parents never really stop being parents.”
00:14:31 Among the very best things you can give to your children
00:14:35 are love, time, and Bible-based training
00:14:40 —yes, endeavoring to reach their hearts.
00:14:44 Admittedly, each child will respond differently to the training.
00:14:50 However, many who have been raised by parents that love Jehovah
00:14:54 feel like Joanna Mae, a sister in Asia.
00:14:58 She says:
00:14:59 “Looking back on the training I received from my parents,
00:15:03 “I am so thankful that they disciplined me
00:15:06 “and taught me to love Jehovah.
00:15:10 “They did not just give me life,
00:15:12 they gave me a meaningful life.”
00:15:16 And there are millions of adult Christians
00:15:19 who would express similar sentiments of appreciation.
00:15:24 Parents, take care of your inheritance, your precious children,
00:15:29 by training them and reaching their heart.
00:15:34 Thank you for those encouraging comments, Gerrit.
00:15:37 I especially appreciated all the comments from the young ones.
00:15:42 One in particular expressed appreciation
00:15:45 for the Caleb and Sophia videos.
00:15:47 We’ve grown quite attached
00:15:49 to these characters, haven’t we?
00:15:51 In our next segment, Brother Anthony Morris of the Governing Body
00:15:55 discusses how this series has helped children and their parents.
00:16:13 It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost a decade
00:16:18 since that first release in 2012.
00:16:22 In that time,
00:16:24 the Become Jehovah’s Friend  series
00:16:26 has proved to be a real gift from Jehovah.
00:16:32 Through these Bible lessons, children can learn to be kind,
00:16:37 to be honest,
00:16:38 to be respectful,
00:16:40 and to develop other godly qualities
00:16:43 that help them see and obey
00:16:47 “the One who is invisible.”
00:16:50 How can we begin to understand
00:16:52 the far-reaching impact
00:16:54 this series has had on Christian families?
00:16:58 We’re going to let Christian parents tell
00:17:01 how these videos have helped their children
00:17:05 to become Jehovah’s friend.
00:17:10 Kady-Ann had a really hard time
00:17:12 working together with the older brothers
00:17:14 and sisters in the congregation.
00:17:16 I had a really hard time because
00:17:22 they’re kind of slow.
00:17:25 But Lesson 25: Making Friends
00:17:30 was just what I needed.
00:17:32 We spent a few weeks discussing the videos
00:17:35 during our Family Worship evening.
00:17:39 The videos helped her to be more open-minded
00:17:42 —to be more respectful to the elderly brothers and sisters
00:17:45 and want to work with them in field service.
00:17:51 Sophia liked chatting with Sister Elsa,
00:17:53 even though she’s so old.
00:17:56 So I can do that too.
00:17:58 These videos strengthened
00:18:01 my relationship with Jehovah.
00:18:03 I know that he hasn’t forgotten me as a single parent.
00:18:08 It can be so hard for single parents
00:18:12 because they are trying to take on the role of both parents.
00:18:18 I got baptized because I love Jehovah
00:18:21 with my whole heart.
00:18:24 Jehovah still loves me, even though I’m made from dust,
00:18:28 and I’m so little.
00:18:31 He took some of the weight off my shoulders.
00:18:40 Laura,
00:18:42 our middle child,
00:18:43 was perfectly healthy
00:18:45 until she turned four years old.
00:18:48 That’s when she was diagnosed with a rare tumor
00:18:51 in her central nervous system.
00:18:53 Unfortunately, when the treatment was over, Laura passed away.
00:19:01 Even while she was sick,
00:19:03 she just loved watching the videos.
00:19:06 Her favorite one was Let’s Go in Service.
00:19:10 This video really made her want to talk about Jehovah.
00:19:13 During the time that she was receiving
00:19:15 chemotherapy treatments, which lowered her immunity,
00:19:19 we couldn’t even leave the house with her.
00:19:24 But sometimes we’d bring her to get a checkup or get an exam done,
00:19:29 and the doctor would say that everything was fine for now
00:19:32 —that her immunity was OK.
00:19:33 And the very first thing that she’d say to the doctor was,
00:19:37 “So I can go in the ministry, right?”
00:19:39 And the doctor would laugh and say, “Sure you can.”
00:19:42 And our family would take advantage of those times
00:19:45 to go in field service together as a family —all together.
00:19:49 That made Laura so happy.
00:19:55 It does us good to remember
00:19:58 why the Become Jehovah’s Friend  series was created.
00:20:04 These videos were not designed as mere entertainment
00:20:09 to simply pacify children for a short period of time.
00:20:14 These lessons were designed to help children
00:20:17 build a relationship with Jehovah
00:20:21 so that they can live and serve him forever.
00:20:26 Jehovah loves children.
00:20:29 That love was evident in how his Son, Jesus Christ,
00:20:34 treated children.
00:20:36 The Governing Body shares that love as well.
00:20:41 Also,
00:20:42 Jehovah loves Christian parents.
00:20:46 He sees how hard you work to impress
00:20:49 a love for God deep in your child’s heart.
00:20:54 No doubt you look forward to sharing
00:20:57 every new video with your child
00:20:59 to help him learn to love and respect Jehovah,
00:21:04 Jesus, and God’s Word.
00:21:07 But more important,
00:21:09 how do you think Jehovah feels
00:21:12 knowing that a young child can come to know him
00:21:16 through this animated series
00:21:18 and grow up to become his dedicated servant?
00:21:23 That is truly special.
00:21:29 We will continue to pray
00:21:31 that this series reaches the hearts of our young ones
00:21:35 and draws them closer to Jehovah
00:21:38 —their Friend now and forever.
00:21:46 As we heard, Become Jehovah’s Friend
00:21:49 is much more than an enjoyable animated series.
00:21:53 These videos are powerful teaching tools
00:21:56 that help young ones develop a personal relationship with Jehovah.
00:22:00 Parents, continue to use them wisely
00:22:04 as part of your family worship.
00:22:07 Of course, at some point in their lives,
00:22:10 children must make the truth their own.
00:22:13 What steps can they take
00:22:15 to establish their identity as servants of Jehovah?
00:22:19 That’s the topic of the next episode of My Teen Life.
00:22:34 Me and my mum started attending meetings
00:22:37 and studying the Bible when I was five years old.
00:22:40 When I was 13, I decided to get baptized.
00:22:45 I decided to dedicate my life
00:22:47 to Jehovah when I was 14.
00:22:50 To me, Jehovah is a wonderful God.
00:22:53 He’s not just a Friend that you can count on  but also a Father.
00:22:58 I don’t have a spiritual father here on earth,
00:23:01 but I have Jehovah as my Father.
00:23:05 It was always something that I had in mind
00:23:08 —to let the truth convince me
00:23:10 and not serve Jehovah just because my family does,
00:23:13 but to serve Jehovah because of the love I feel for him.
00:23:16 Having that clearly in mind is very important
00:23:19 and will make all the difference  when a problem arises,
00:23:22 or when we have to deal with something, in the future.
00:23:24 Some of the truths that convinced me
00:23:28 that Jehovah was really my God
00:23:30 were mainly basic truths.
00:23:33 I believe that they’re like the foundation of a house.
00:23:37 Without a good base, a good foundation,
00:23:41 a house will not remain standing.
00:23:44 For example, I wanted to understand better
00:23:48 from a more scientific standpoint
00:23:50 that Jehovah really created all things.
00:23:54 So I read a lesson from the brochure Origin of Life.
00:23:57 From that, I saw how Jehovah really made everything
00:24:01 in a very complex way and that there was no other explanation.
00:24:07 It was doubts like that that moved me to study the Bible more,
00:24:12 which helped me to build a better friendship with Jehovah
00:24:15 and to be more convinced that he was the true God.
00:24:19 I always enjoyed and made a great effort
00:24:22 to feed myself in a spiritual sense in the morning.
00:24:25 When I was a teenager,
00:24:26 I went through some problems that were pretty tough.
00:24:30 I felt better in the morning.
00:24:32 It was a time of day when my problems
00:24:35 didn’t seem so big in my mind.
00:24:38 It’s very important to have spiritual goals.
00:24:41 Because if we don’t have goals,
00:24:43 it’s like going on a journey with no direction, no destination.
00:24:48 But if we’ve got a purpose before leaving, we know where we are going
00:24:52 and how we can get there safely.
00:24:54 I always think in terms of setting short-range goals,
00:24:57 medium-range goals, and long-range goals.
00:25:00 So some goals that I was able to reach
00:25:02 were getting baptized and becoming a regular pioneer.
00:25:05 I also had the privilege  of serving in construction groups.
00:25:08 No matter the choices that I had to make,
00:25:11 I always thought about how they would affect my goals in the future.
00:25:15 When I was 17,
00:25:17 I found out that my mum had cancer.
00:25:20 That was a heartbreaking situation.
00:25:23 Suddenly, my life was turned upside down.
00:25:28 I had to learn how to care for our home, how to cook,
00:25:32 how to care for someone sick,
00:25:34 and how to give emotional support to that person.
00:25:38 The biggest challenge that I faced when I was a teenager
00:25:41 was when my parents got divorced,
00:25:44 and then my mum stopped serving Jehovah.
00:25:47 At that time in my life, I was 15 or 16 years old.
00:25:52 At that age, you need a lot of support
00:25:54 and guidance from your parents.
00:25:56 It was a time when I didn’t get that guidance and that support.
00:26:00 My mum was my best friend, and I lost her.
00:26:06 She was always so loving.
00:26:10 She always helped me.
00:26:12 She always read the publications with me.
00:26:15 We loved to study the Bible together.
00:26:21 We don’t know when problems will suddenly come up.
00:26:27 So it’s important that we take
00:26:29 Jehovah’s side before the challenges,
00:26:31 before problems, arise.
00:26:34 A text that really helped me
00:26:37 was Romans 8:37-39.
00:26:40 There it says that ‘neither death
00:26:43 ‘nor life nor height nor depth
00:26:45 ‘nor anything else
00:26:48 can separate us from Jehovah’s love.’
00:26:50 So that really helped me face those challenges.
00:26:53 Having a strong Christian identity
00:26:57 means having values and principles
00:27:00 that are the same as Jehovah’s.
00:27:04 You clearly make up your mind to please Jehovah,
00:27:07 even with what’s happening all around you.
00:27:10 It’s very important to make the choice to serve Jehovah
00:27:13 no matter the situation we face
00:27:16 or no matter if our family serves Jehovah or not,
00:27:20 because it’s when we face challenging situations
00:27:23 that we’ll see if we can continue to be loyal to Jehovah or not.
00:27:27 No doubt about it,
00:27:29 I’m very proud to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:27:32 Jehovah can help us in amazing ways.
00:27:36 He is our Friend, our Father, our Comforter.
00:27:41 It’s really good to be friends with a God that is so powerful
00:27:45 and to have the chance to defend his name.
00:28:10 Establishing your identity as a Christian
00:28:13 isn’t a single decision or just a moment in time.
00:28:17 As Tainara and Alex shared,
00:28:21 it’s a process that leads to wonderful blessings.
00:28:26 In many respects, marriage is like that.
00:28:29 A wedding is a special day,
00:28:32 but marriage is something that wives and husbands
00:28:35 need to strengthen every day.
00:28:40 To help Christian couples,
00:28:42 the Governing Body has approved the development
00:28:44 of a new series.
00:28:47 It’s called For a Happy Marriage.
00:28:52 Each segment features dramatizations
00:28:55 of real marital challenges
00:28:57 and how Bible principles can help us
00:29:00 build healthy, loving relationships.
00:29:04 Here’s our first episode.
00:29:28 As married couples,
00:29:32 most of us have been there.
00:29:37 The day-to-day pace of life,
00:29:40 work,
00:29:44 and distractions
00:29:48 can cause us
00:29:50 to draw away from our mate emotionally.
00:30:05 We begin to talk less
00:30:10 —distance ourselves.
00:30:16 We may feel unappreciated
00:30:28 and even become cold or unkind.
00:30:32 Even our desire for intimacy and affection may cool.
00:30:37 We may go from being loving and passionate
00:30:42 to platonic roommates.
00:30:47 What can we do to avoid this?
00:30:52 An excellent principle we can apply
00:30:55 is found at Acts 20:35:
00:30:58 “There is more happiness
00:31:00 in giving than there is in receiving.”
00:31:07 But how can we know what to give
00:31:11 or what actions to take so our mate
00:31:13 feels our love and affection?
00:31:18 The best way to know
00:31:22 is simply to ask.
00:31:25 What does our mate need?
00:31:33 Some feel loved
00:31:36 when they are actively listened to
00:31:40 or hear warm expressions of appreciation.
00:31:45 For others, it’s expressions of love shown through touch
00:31:49 or simply quality time.
00:31:53 Others find
00:31:54 that helping them with chores and sharing the workload at home
00:31:58 makes them feel cherished.
00:32:03 But whatever the discussion reveals
00:32:05 and regardless of our mate’s imperfections,
00:32:13 we want to do what we can
00:32:15 to make them feel loved and cared for
00:32:20 through the actions they appreciate.
00:32:32 Yes, if we each do all we can to show unselfish love,
00:32:40 genuine affection will follow.
00:32:50 And this is just one of many secrets
00:32:53 to a happy marriage.
00:33:01 So now, why not just take a moment, pause the video,
00:33:05 and ask each other these three questions.
00:33:10 Remember, share your honest feelings,
00:33:13 and when listening, don’t be defensive.
00:33:16 This is simply a chance to openly express how each of you feels.
00:33:21 So pause your video now, and really talk.
00:33:29 As we see, this series is designed to encourage couples
00:33:33 to have open and honest discussions with each other.
00:33:37 These videos will be so helpful for husbands and wives
00:33:41 and for those who are thinking about getting married.
00:33:44 We are thankful to the Governing Body for this series,
00:33:47 and we look forward to future episodes.
00:33:51 Whether we are married or single, have children or not,
00:33:55 all of us are part of Jehovah’s family.
00:33:58 We love each other and help one another,
00:34:01 especially during times of distress.
00:34:04 In our next segment, we’ll see how Jehovah’s spiritual family
00:34:08 helped Brother Baston Nyirenda endure years of intense hardship.
00:41:10 How faith-strengthening to see
00:41:12 how the brotherhood was a powerful source of encouragement for Brother Nyirenda!
00:41:17 Of course, persecution continues to affect
00:41:20 many of our brothers today.
00:41:22 Jehovah’s spiritual family
00:41:24 steadfastly prays for and helps each one of them to endure.
00:41:30 Next, we’ll enjoy a recent morning worship
00:41:33 presented by Brother William Malenfant.
00:41:36 He describes the power of parental training.
00:41:43 I think all of us have had
00:41:45 very interesting experiences with young ones,
00:41:48 and we could go on quite a while
00:41:49 speaking about them.
00:41:51 But there is a story
00:41:53 about a “child psychologist
00:41:57 “who began his practice with four theories
00:42:02 “and no children. . . .
00:42:05 “Some years later he found that he had four children
00:42:08 and no theories!”
00:42:12 He learned that there was quite a bit to do.
00:42:15 There was a lot to do to raise a child.
00:42:18 It was far more than just a few theories.
00:42:21 And this was a comment that was reported by psychologist Bruce Narramore
00:42:26 and published in the Awake!  of April 8, 1981.
00:42:31 So theories about child raising come and go,
00:42:35 and the best counsel on raising a child, of course, is found in the Bible.
00:42:39 We know that, because it’s been there for thousands of years,
00:42:43 and it’s consistent.
00:42:45 It’s consistently successful.
00:42:48 There’s another interesting point
00:42:50 that there is four times as much counsel
00:42:53 given to children in the book of Proverbs
00:42:56 as given to adults.
00:42:58 That might surprise you, but that’s what I read, so I believe it.
00:43:04 Proverbs 22:6 is a familiar scripture for all of us.
00:43:09 Proverbs 22:6, and here it says:
00:43:13 “Train a boy in the way he should go;
00:43:17 even when he grows old he will not depart from it.”
00:43:23 Is that true?
00:43:24 Yes, it’s true.
00:43:27 Does it mean that in every case
00:43:29 a boy that’s well-trained by his parents won’t depart from it?
00:43:32 No. It does not mean that.
00:43:35 It’s giving a general, overall view
00:43:37 of what will take place
00:43:39 if a child is trained properly by his parents.
00:43:43 And what it is, this is an interesting brief statement
00:43:48 from The Watchtower  of 2008, April 1st
00:43:51 that if a child is trained according to the Bible’s counsel,
00:43:55 the parent or parents “are creating
00:43:58 “the most favorable circumstances
00:44:01 to bring about a marvelous result.”
00:44:04 That marvelous result is
00:44:06 a faithful servant of Jehovah God.
00:44:09 And we can turn to Proverbs 23:24
00:44:12 where reference is made to that
00:44:16 —Proverbs 23:24.
00:44:18 And how many parents are so delighted with their children,
00:44:21 especially in the case of so many who are serving at Bethel!
00:44:26 There at Proverbs 23:24, it says:
00:44:29 “The father of a righteous one will surely be joyful;
00:44:33 whoever fathers a wise son will rejoice in him.”
00:44:37 And it does; it brings great pleasure to parents when that happens.
00:44:41 But there’s another side to the coin.
00:44:44 Despite the most earnest efforts of parents,
00:44:47 some children do become unfaithful.
00:44:52 Think about Solomon.
00:44:53 He wasn’t a child, but actually,
00:44:56 it’s very difficult to understand
00:44:58 how that man turned away from Jehovah in his old age, but he did.
00:45:03 And then even Jehovah had sons who proved unfaithful.
00:45:06 That’s what the June 1, 2007, Watchtower
00:45:09 showed clearly, and we’re all familiar with it
00:45:11 —the angels who turned away from their Father, their Creator.
00:45:15 And something to keep in mind
00:45:17 for parents, particularly, who have really tried hard
00:45:20 to raise their children properly,
00:45:24 we don’t want to see them beat themselves figuratively speaking,
00:45:27 on and on for years and years
00:45:29 because they feel like they’re failures.
00:45:32 They should not do that.
00:45:33 How do you account —if it seems to some parents
00:45:36 that know somehow they failed—
00:45:38 Well then, how do you account for children
00:45:41 who receive no help whatsoever from their parents
00:45:44 and they love Jehovah and they come into the truth?
00:45:47 It’s heart—heart condition.
00:45:50 So parents would be wise to focus on the future and what they can do,
00:45:55 not to look back and beat themselves
00:45:57 over problems of the past.
00:46:00 And even when children do turn aside from serving Jehovah,
00:46:05 parents who have conscientiously trained their children
00:46:09 in the way to walk,
00:46:10 they can still entertain the hope
00:46:12 that those young ones will come back some day.
00:46:15 We never give up on our kids.
00:46:18 We don’t give up on our close friends or siblings
00:46:22 who may have walked away from the truth.
00:46:24 We always hope that they’ll come back.
00:46:27 Psalm 19:7 is interesting
00:46:30 —Psalm 19:7—
00:46:35 speaking of the reminders of Jehovah.
00:46:39 There it reads: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring strength.”
00:46:44 And then it says: “The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,
00:46:48 making the inexperienced one wise.”
00:46:52 Well, for those who leave the truth,
00:46:55 many times it’s reminders that come back to them
00:46:58 —the way it was at home, the counsel they received from their parents,
00:47:02 the loving congregation that they attended.
00:47:06 And who comes to mind when you think about the reminders coming to mind
00:47:11 after living a life of debauchery?
00:47:14 The prodigal son.
00:47:16 He was at his lowest, and then who did he remember?
00:47:20 His father —his father, who undoubtedly had shown
00:47:23 kindness and love to him.
00:47:25 So we don’t want to overlook
00:47:27 the power there is in parental training.
00:47:30 Even though they may not respond
00:47:33 —children may not respond— immediately,
00:47:36 they do many times later on.
00:47:38 And they go through experiences in life, sometimes,
00:47:40 that wake them up to the facts of life and reality.
00:47:45 The truth is there are thousands upon thousands
00:47:48 of children of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:47:50 who are being raised in the truth and whose way “is pure and right.”
00:47:53 It really is thrilling to see young ones who are able to think.
00:47:57 They don’t just parrot what their parents tell them.
00:47:59 They’re not just memorizing things.
00:48:02 They’ve learned to have thinking ability, and they can speak about the truth.
00:48:05 They defend the truth in a very interesting way.
00:48:09 In Britain, Tim and Sam, both 11 years old and unbaptized publishers,
00:48:14 were engaging in field service with Tim’s mother.
00:48:18 The boys needed new bags to carry their Bibles and literature,
00:48:22 but money was a problem.
00:48:25 Earlier, before starting in the field service that day,
00:48:28 the mothers of the two publishers made this a subject of prayer.
00:48:32 At the last house to be visited that morning,
00:48:35 Tim spoke to the householder and read a Bible verse to her.
00:48:39 She interrupted him to ask what his religion was.
00:48:43 When Tim replied that he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:48:47 the woman scolded him
00:48:49 and said to his mother that she could not understand
00:48:51 why Jehovah’s Witnesses let their children die
00:48:54 rather than allow them to accept blood transfusions.
00:48:58 Now, that would be a difficult thing to have thrown in your face
00:49:01 for a young man there at the door with his mother.
00:49:04 Tim’s mother suggested that the woman ask the boys
00:49:07 how they felt about this.
00:49:10 She did.
00:49:12 Tim explained that he would always choose alternative treatment
00:49:16 rather than go against his Bible-trained conscience.
00:49:19 This was from this young boy himself.
00:49:23 Sam then said, the other young boy,
00:49:26 that his own sister had received alternative treatment
00:49:29 and had fared better than patients who had received blood.
00:49:35 Then the householder again turned to Tim’s mother,
00:49:38 and this time she expressed disapproval
00:49:41 of taking young children from door to door.
00:49:44 We’ve heard that many times, I’m sure.
00:49:46 Both of the boys responded to the woman on this occasion
00:49:50 that they enjoyed preaching, adding that they preferred this
00:49:53 to roaming the streets like others of their age.
00:49:57 Well, this slowed the householder down a bit.
00:50:00 She was impressed by their reply.
00:50:02 The householder asked the boys to wait a moment
00:50:04 while she went into her house.
00:50:06 What a surprise they had when she returned and presented each of them
00:50:11 with a smart, new, leather bag
00:50:14 ideal for their ministry!
00:50:16 She sold these items for a living.
00:50:19 Her changed attitude also allowed the boys to arrange for a return visit.
00:50:23 And as they were leaving,
00:50:25 the householder’s 94-year-old mother, who had been listening,
00:50:29 came to the door and asked Tim’s mother
00:50:32 to visit her at her home.
00:50:35 Truly, we are proud of our young ones.
00:50:38 And it’s a delight when you hear them
00:50:41 make comments at the meetings in their own words
00:50:44 and when you are out in the field ministry with them
00:50:47 and you see them make expressions of faith.
00:50:50 We have thousands upon thousands of good children
00:50:54 who really are showing that they’re mature and that they love Jehovah God.
00:51:00 In our program, we have been reminded
00:51:03 that each of us belongs to a loving, global family
00:51:08 —Jehovah’s family.
00:51:10 And as our new music video shows,
00:51:13 each of us can help others become part of our spiritual family.
00:51:36 In this world, it’s hard to find a friend—
00:51:43 Someone you can turn to who’s with you till the end.
00:51:50 I used to dream I’d find a people who could be
00:51:57 More than just some friends and more like family.
00:52:12 My search is over. I’ve come to know
00:52:20 I’ve finally found God’s people; I feel the love they show.
00:52:28 Now I live that dream that meant so much to me.
00:52:35 I found more than friends; I found Jehovah’s family.
00:52:43 Now I have brothers; I have sisters, mothers, fathers too,
00:52:54 Little boys and little girls, older brothers who
00:53:01 Come from ev’ry tribe and race and nationality.
00:53:10 We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.
00:53:20 We love each other; our bond is strong.
00:53:26 We love to have the honor of knowing we belong
00:53:34 To the greatest brotherhood we’ll ever see. We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.
00:54:07 Yes, we come from ev’ry race and nationality. We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.
00:54:26 Our God invites us to be more than a friend.
00:54:32 He wants us in his fam’ly; his love will never end.
00:54:40 Just to think that we will live eternally,
00:54:47 Then we’ll all be part of Jehovah’s family— A part of Jehovah’s family,
00:55:10 Family, Family.
00:55:28 What an encouraging video
00:55:30 and an appropriate one for this month’s broadcast,
00:55:34 which has been all about family!
00:55:37 Alex, thank you for being my cohost.
00:55:40 You’re welcome, Gerrit.
00:55:42 In our program,
00:55:44 we were reminded that our animated series
00:55:47 Become Jehovah’s Friend is a very effective teaching tool
00:55:51 that continues to delight and help children and parents.
00:55:55 We learned how teens can develop a strong identity as a servant of Jehovah
00:56:00 and how this helps them stand firm for their convictions.
00:56:05 And we introduced an encouraging new series, For a Happy Marriage,
00:56:10 and we were reminded of the importance
00:56:12 of showing our marriage mate affection.
00:56:15 Now it’s time for our video postcard, which comes to us
00:56:19 from Zambia.
00:56:22 Situated in south-central Africa,
00:56:25 Zambia is a land of vast open spaces,
00:56:29 abundant wildlife,
00:56:31 and spectacular waterways.
00:56:34 It takes its name from the Zambezi River,
00:56:37 which flows into Victoria Falls.
00:56:40 Particularly at flood stage,
00:56:42 Victoria Falls is considered the largest sheet of falling water on earth,
00:56:47 with up to 144 million gallons,
00:56:50 or 545 million liters,
00:56:54 plunging over the falls every minute.
00:56:58 In the past,
00:57:00 Jehovah’s Witnesses in Zambia
00:57:01 faced strong opposition
00:57:03 fueled by nationalism.
00:57:05 During the 1960’s,
00:57:08 thousands of children of Jehovah’s Witnesses were expelled from school
00:57:11 for refusing to salute the flag.
00:57:14 Door-to-door preaching was banned.
00:57:17 But with Jehovah’s help,
00:57:18 the brothers persevered
00:57:21 and many have embraced the truth.
00:57:24 Today Zambia is home
00:57:26 to more than 225,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:57:31 To serve publishers in areas with poor network service,
00:57:34 the circuit overseer prerecords his talks,
00:57:37 transfers the files onto a flash drive,
00:57:40 and delivers the files to the elders, who then distribute the talks.
00:57:46 Let’s visit the Lusaka Rockfield Congregation.
00:57:50 During the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:57:53 the brothers showed great zeal in the ministry.
00:57:57 The congregation grew to the point that a new congregation was formed
00:58:01 to support the territory.
00:58:03 Attendance at meetings and assemblies during the pandemic
00:58:06 was strong.
00:58:08 Young ones in the congregation help translate Kingdom songs.
00:58:13 Our brothers and sisters
00:58:15 in the Lusaka Rockfield Congregation in Zambia send you
00:58:19 their love and greetings!
00:58:22 And we send our love to all of you as well.
00:58:27 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:58:30 this is JW Broadcasting!
