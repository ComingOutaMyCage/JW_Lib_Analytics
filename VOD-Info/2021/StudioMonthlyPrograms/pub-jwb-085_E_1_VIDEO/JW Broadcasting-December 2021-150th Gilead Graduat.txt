00:00:01 We’re delighted you could join us.
00:00:04 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®
00:00:06 for December 2021!
00:00:27 The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead
00:00:30 has now completed 150 classes!
00:00:34 This certainly is a theocratic milestone
00:00:37 made possible with Jehovah’s help.
00:00:41 This 150th class was a little different.
00:00:45 There were only 24 students, which is much less than usual.
00:00:50 And because of travel restrictions based on the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:00:55 all are citizens of the United States.
00:00:59 Though this group was different than in years past,
00:01:03 the goal remained the same:
00:01:05 to strengthen their faith so that they can strengthen others
00:01:09 wherever they are assigned.
00:01:12 The graduation program helped the students
00:01:15 to focus on key points they will benefit from on into the future.
00:01:20 Please enjoy Part 1 of the graduation
00:01:23 that was held on Saturday, September 11, 2021,
00:01:28 at the Watchtower Educational Center
00:01:30 in Patterson, New York!
00:01:33 I’m going to go back many decades ago
00:01:38 —Monday, March 6, 1972.
00:01:43 Now, some of you in the class weren’t alive.
00:01:48 I think I know of one for sure who was alive.
00:01:52 That’s an inside joke, not Inside Story
00:01:57 —but anyway.
00:01:59 And along with my wife, we had the privilege
00:02:04 (and that was rare unless you were a Bethelite)
00:02:06 to attend the graduation
00:02:09 of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.
00:02:11 That was the 52nd class.
00:02:14 So we’re in the Assembly Hall
00:02:17 (jam packed there in New York City)
00:02:20 and just enjoying it.
00:02:23 What a privilege for us to sit there
00:02:26 and enjoy that program of the 52nd class!
00:02:30 Now here we are almost 100 (just two shy) classes later
00:02:35 —the 150th class.
00:02:38 And now we’re grateful
00:02:40 because many are tied in live as we speak.
00:02:45 But then the rest of the brotherhood
00:02:47 is going to have it available in a few months.
00:02:50 So boy, things have changed, and they enjoy that privilege.
00:02:54 But that was a rare privilege.
00:02:56 And I remember Brother Knorr was the chairman
00:03:00 of the program.
00:03:02 And certainly, he just loved Gilead.
00:03:06 I mean, that you’ve got to give him.
00:03:09 Of course, Jehovah used him mightily to get it all started there
00:03:13 —1943 was the first one.
00:03:15 But knowing that the beast was coming out,
00:03:20 Jehovah blessed them and said, ‘Yeah, we need a missionary school.’
00:03:24 There was a missionary school for years.
00:03:26 But anyway, the thing I wanted to mention is that I remember an outstanding talk.
00:03:31 I had heard Brother Fred Franz the summer before
00:03:35 at the Yankee Stadium convention,
00:03:38 but we were a little closer there in the Assembly Hall.
00:03:41 And I’ll tell you what; I was just glued to him.
00:03:44 If you had the privilege to hear him, Jehovah blessed—
00:03:47 He had a blessed, beautiful mind.
00:03:50 He could just quote these scriptures.
00:03:52 And I’ve told folks:
00:03:54 “Now, if you don’t pay attention and stay with him,
00:03:58 “you’re going to get lost.
00:04:00 He’s going to lose you.”
00:04:01 But if you paid attention, it was thrilling
00:04:04 just to hear him pour out his heart
00:04:06 because it was all written on his figurative heart.
00:04:09 But he discussed Ecclesiastes 5.
00:04:11 That’s why I was thinking of bringing it up for your class here.
00:04:15 Because this is really directed to you.
00:04:18 And he spoke there about vows.
00:04:21 In those first seven verses, dreams are mentioned.
00:04:25 And I appreciate it because it just struck me when he mentioned it.
00:04:30 The dreams don’t refer to dreams one has while they’re sleeping
00:04:35 because of the busy day.
00:04:37 Now, you can’t get that on your own
00:04:40 by just reading Ecclesiastes with whatever version you have.
00:04:44 It had to do with getting sidetracked
00:04:48 with personal pursuits.
00:04:50 These dreams —these are the things they’re doing.
00:04:53 And that would be “vanity” (as we’d said then).
00:04:58 So let’s just take a moment
00:05:00 (you here in the class and others who want to follow along in Ecclesiastes 5)
00:05:04 and just touch on some of the nice things.
00:05:06 And, of course, you could—
00:05:09 Now, don’t do it right now, but you can do it later.
00:05:12 You have access to the Research Guide
00:05:15 —an in-depth understanding
00:05:18 of this wisdom in Ecclesiastes.
00:05:21 And Brother Franz addressed it.
00:05:24 For example, verse 1 says: “Watch your step.”
00:05:28 So this is for you soon-to-be graduates.
00:05:32 Jehovah is saying: “Watch your step.”
00:05:34 Don’t stop doing that.
00:05:36 You have thus far, so continue to “watch your step.”
00:05:41 And he mentions those morally “stupid ones.”
00:05:45 That’s not you.
00:05:47 You can avoid that.
00:05:49 And then I love this in verse 2:
00:05:52 “Do not be quick with your mouth.”
00:05:56 Boy, there are a lot of people in the world who could benefit from that counsel.
00:06:00 Isn’t that true?
00:06:02 It’s like: ‘Does he or she ever shut up?
00:06:06 ‘I mean, they must— I bet you they talk in their sleep.
00:06:09 They just won’t shut up.’
00:06:12 Then, anyway, ‘don’t be quick with your mouth,’
00:06:14 particularly in context here
00:06:17 when you’re speaking to Jehovah.
00:06:19 Boy, those are some good things to keep in mind,
00:06:21 especially for you brothers who will speak in public.
00:06:24 But you sisters too, when it’s personal with your prayers to Jehovah,
00:06:28 don’t be quick with your mouth
00:06:30 when you approach the Sovereign of the universe.
00:06:34 Your words should be few.
00:06:36 You do not impress God with vocabulary.
00:06:41 He’s impressed with sincerity of heart.
00:06:45 He loves those who love him.
00:06:49 And in all different languages, he treasures those prayers.
00:06:53 And then he mentions this:
00:06:55 “A dream comes from too many preoccupations.”
00:06:59 In the revised Bible here, it says “too many cares.”
00:07:02 So this idea isn’t just dreams from a busy, busy day.
00:07:07 This preoccupation with self
00:07:10 is being warned against here.
00:07:14 Don’t do it. See, do not do it.
00:07:17 Don’t be preoccupied with yourself.
00:07:21 And for those who are, there are many words from them.
00:07:25 But be careful, you know.
00:07:28 You have the privilege now; you’ll be praying more in public
00:07:32 —probably more than you ever have before.
00:07:35 You get privileges, you know.
00:07:37 And when you’re praying to Jehovah, sometimes—
00:07:42 We don’t want to be counseling or criticizing prayers.
00:07:44 We try to be careful of that.
00:07:46 But sometimes you even hear a prayer at Bethel, and it’s like:
00:07:50 ‘OK. We’re trying to eat breakfast here.’
00:07:57 And I’ve told folks that it’s like, you know, I just can’t help but—
00:08:01 Jesus is there, the most eloquent person to walk the planet,
00:08:06 and the meal comes.
00:08:08 He ‘raised his eyes to heaven’ and “gave thanks.”
00:08:13 “Amen.
00:08:17 Let’s eat.”
00:08:19 I mean, there are other times you want to pour out your heart and all that,
00:08:22 but you’re not praying to the audience.
00:08:26 You’re talking to the Sovereign of the universe.
00:08:28 The counsel is, you know—
00:08:31 “Now I’m a Gilead graduate
00:08:33 (you brothers particularly), so I’m going to have longer prayers.”
00:08:36 I hope not.
00:08:38 I sure hope not unless they’re private.
00:08:42 But then he gets into something crucial,
00:08:46 and it’s just so important to keep in mind verse 4.
00:08:51 Let’s read verses 4 and 5:
00:08:54 “Whenever you make a vow to God,
00:08:56 “do not delay to pay it,
00:09:00 for he finds no pleasure in the stupid ones [morally stupid].”
00:09:04 Then it’s very clear:
00:09:06 “What you vow, pay.”
00:09:09 “What you vow, pay.”
00:09:11 And then: “[It’s] better for you not to vow
00:09:15 than to vow and not pay.”
00:09:17 So this is serious counsel,
00:09:20 and the warning is, Don’t allow your mouth to cause you to sin.
00:09:25 So when it comes to vows (and some of you are married),
00:09:30 well, you have the vow.
00:09:32 You always have to hold on to that.
00:09:35 It’s not a light matter with Jehovah God.
00:09:38 And any other vows—be careful.
00:09:41 If you’re going to make a vow, it’s between you and him.
00:09:43 But see, notice here:
00:09:47 “Do not allow [in verse 6] your mouth to cause you to sin,
00:09:51 “and do not say before the angel
00:09:53 “[see, think about this]
00:09:56 that it was a mistake.”
00:09:59 So Jehovah has the angels doing all sorts of things.
00:10:03 We don’t even begin to know the things
00:10:05 that are always going on all the time
00:10:07 with Jehovah’s servants and his holy angels.
00:10:11 It’s priceless.
00:10:12 But see, angels are, according to this,
00:10:16 assigned to check on these things.
00:10:18 So you don’t say to the angel:
00:10:21 “Why, look, I made a mistake. Forgive me.”
00:10:25 Uh-uh.
00:10:27 You made a vow.
00:10:29 But see, it shouldn’t be because an angel is going to check
00:10:32 that that’s Jehovah’s direction.
00:10:35 It should be because of our love for Jehovah.
00:10:41 When you make a vow (you know, whether it was marriage or whatever),
00:10:45 it’s your love for Jehovah —that’s what cements the vow.
00:10:50 It matters.
00:10:52 See, it matters to him.
00:10:56 So then finally, in verse 7:
00:11:00 “For just as many preoccupations lead to dreams,
00:11:04 so, too, many words lead to futility.”
00:11:08 So it’s good counsel.
00:11:10 You are so filled
00:11:14 with the Word of God.
00:11:16 This is a special class,
00:11:18 and Gilead is a special school.
00:11:22 We have other schools, SKE; I’ll mention something later about that.
00:11:26 But this is unique
00:11:29 —to have men whom Jehovah has appointed to instruct.
00:11:33 The Teaching Committee selects them
00:11:36 —totally whole-souled and devoted to Jehovah God—
00:11:41 to teach you during the class.
00:11:43 And you’re going over all these things in the Word of God.
00:11:46 And so it’s all in there,
00:11:49 and it’s just special.
00:11:52 So you thank Jehovah that you have this education,
00:11:56 and you’re going to move forward to glorify him.
00:12:02 And that’s pretty similar to what is mentioned here
00:12:06 in the last sentence in verse 7:
00:12:10 “But fear the true God.”
00:12:14 So you soon-to-be graduates,
00:12:16 keep those words in your heart.
00:12:19 Just “fear the true God” in the days ahead,
00:12:23 and stay away from these kind of dreams
00:12:28 about self-preoccupation, you know?
00:12:33 Mm-mm. No, not for you.
00:12:37 Otherwise, your education was futile,
00:12:42 not good.
00:12:43 And I don’t see that in any of you (and I’m not implying).
00:12:47 But it’s such wise counsel
00:12:50 from Jehovah God in his Word.
00:12:52 So there’s much, much more there.
00:12:55 Enjoy thinking about it
00:12:57 with a little tool we have there, the Research Guide.
00:13:02 Now, we appreciate the next speaker very much
00:13:07 (and he put his heart into his talk),
00:13:10 Brother Mark Sanderson.
00:13:12 And we have a nice lineup
00:13:15 of the brothers who’ve prepared their talks
00:13:17 with all their heart.
00:13:20 Mark is a member of the Governing Body,
00:13:22 and his talk is a question as a theme,
00:13:26 “What Will They Be Like?”
00:13:30 Brother Sanderson, please.
00:13:39 At Luke 6:40, Jesus said:
00:13:44 “A student is not above his teacher,
00:13:48 “but everyone who is perfectly instructed
00:13:52 will be like his teacher.”
00:13:55 Well, now, what comes to your mind when you think about this verse?
00:13:59 Maybe you tend to think of it in terms
00:14:01 of when you conduct a Bible study with someone.
00:14:04 Or you might think about it
00:14:06 when you go to a program like Gilead
00:14:09 and you’re instructed there.
00:14:12 But in reality,
00:14:14 we are all teachers every day
00:14:18 in the classroom of Christian living.
00:14:23 If we have responsibilities,
00:14:25 if we enjoy certain privileges,
00:14:28 our brothers and sisters will watch us.
00:14:33 And those who work closely with us
00:14:36 will learn from us.
00:14:38 And they will become like us.
00:14:43 Take the example of the apostle Paul.
00:14:47 Now, we know Paul was an outstanding teacher.
00:14:50 Can you imagine?
00:14:51 Under inspiration, he had the privilege to write 14 books
00:14:56 of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:14:59 Yet, that was not the only way
00:15:02 that the apostle Paul taught others.
00:15:05 His example in Christian living
00:15:08 was very powerful.
00:15:10 Now, what could people learn from the example of Paul?
00:15:14 Let’s consider some examples.
00:15:16 Let’s go first to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,
00:15:21 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,
00:15:25 and let’s look at verse 7:
00:15:27 “On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst,
00:15:32 “as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.
00:15:36 “So having tender affection for you,
00:15:40 “we were determined to impart to you,
00:15:42 “not only the good news of God
00:15:45 “but also our very selves,
00:15:48 because you became so beloved to us.”
00:15:53 Paul worked hard for the brothers.
00:15:57 He was kind.
00:15:58 He was gentle with them.
00:16:00 He was willing to give not just the message of the truth but,
00:16:04 as he says in verse 8, “our very selves.”
00:16:09 And brothers, that was the truth.
00:16:14 Paul said he was willing to do “all things
00:16:18 for the sake of the good news.”
00:16:20 And just consider some of the things that he did.
00:16:23 Let’s go to 2 Corinthians chapter 11
00:16:26 and just remind ourselves of some of the things Paul went through.
00:16:30 Second Corinthians 11:23
00:16:35 —Paul says: “Are they ministers of Christ?
00:16:38 “I reply like a madman, I am more outstandingly one:
00:16:42 “I have done more work, been imprisoned more often,
00:16:46 “suffered countless beatings, and experienced many near-deaths.
00:16:50 “Five times I received
40 strokes less one from the Jews,
00:16:55 “three times I was beaten with rods,
00:16:57 “once I was stoned, three times I experienced shipwreck,
00:17:02 a night and a day I have spent in the open sea.”
00:17:05 And the list just goes on.
00:17:09 What could these ones
00:17:14 who worked with Paul learn from him?
00:17:17 In other words, how did Paul’s powerful example
00:17:20 of love for God,
00:17:22 of endurance, of hard work,
00:17:25 and of true unselfishness
00:17:27 affect those around him?
00:17:31 Well, consider Timothy, who worked so closely with Paul.
00:17:35 What did Paul say about him?
00:17:37 Let’s go to Philippians chapter 2
00:17:41 —Philippians 2:20.
00:17:46 Paul said: “For I have no one else
00:17:50 “of a disposition like his
00:17:52 “who will genuinely care for your concerns.
00:17:55 “For all the others are seeking their own interests,
00:17:58 “not those of Jesus Christ.
00:18:01 “But you know the proof he gave of himself,
00:18:04 “that like a child with a father
00:18:06 he slaved with me to advance the good news.”
00:18:11 Well, now, here’s a question:
00:18:13 Why was Timothy that way?
00:18:16 Why was Timothy so unselfish?
00:18:19 Why did he work so hard for other people?
00:18:23 Well, no doubt, he was “perfectly instructed”
00:18:27 not just by the words
00:18:30 but by the example of Paul.
00:18:33 Well, the same thing could be true of Priscilla and Aquila.
00:18:37 Paul said about them that they had risked their necks for him.
00:18:42 Well, where did they learn that from?
00:18:45 You see, we could go on with other examples
00:18:48 of other close associates of Paul, but what is the point?
00:18:52 Paul’s example in Christian living
00:18:55 instructed those around him.
00:18:58 They became like Paul.
00:19:01 Now, why is that important to you who are graduating today
00:19:06 from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?
00:19:09 Well, very soon you’re going to be graduates,
00:19:13 and your mandate is to go forth
00:19:16 and strengthen and stabilize
00:19:19 the field and branch territory.
00:19:22 But now, that’s a big long term, isn’t it?
00:19:24 What is the field and branch territory?
00:19:28 It’s people.
00:19:30 It’s people —spiritual men and women
00:19:34 who want to learn,
00:19:37 who want to be trained,
00:19:39 who want to reach the spiritual goals that they’ve set for themselves,
00:19:44 and who want to grow to Christian maturity.
00:19:48 And because you are a Gilead graduate,
00:19:52 they will watch you, they will listen to you,
00:19:56 and they will be instructed by your example.
00:20:01 When I went to serve many years ago
00:20:04 where the need was great on the island of Newfoundland,
00:20:07 we were so blessed to have in our congregation
00:20:11 a graduate of the 7th class of Gilead, Brother Fred Wiens.
00:20:16 Brother Wiens was an anointed brother who was baptized
00:20:20 in 1928.
00:20:22 Now, I’ll be honest with you;
00:20:25 I don’t remember even one talk that Fred Wiens gave.
00:20:29 But his warmth, his sense of humor,
00:20:33 his zeal for the ministry, and his love for people
00:20:37 —the example that he set—
00:20:40 is truly unforgettable.
00:20:43 Fred talked to everyone
00:20:45 —and I mean everyone— in the ministry.
00:20:48 One time we were out in service; we pulled into the gas station.
00:20:52 As soon as we stopped the car, Fred jumped out.
00:20:55 And when we were ready to leave,
00:20:57 we looked around to try to find Fred.
00:21:00 He wasn’t in the store; he wasn’t in the bathroom.
00:21:03 He was nowhere to be seen.
00:21:05 Finally, we thought we’d check the other cars.
00:21:08 Well, that’s exactly where Fred was.
00:21:11 Fred had knocked on the window and gotten in a car
00:21:14 and started to preach to all the people in that car.
00:21:19 Fred has now gone on to his reward.
00:21:22 But his example of warmth, kindness,
00:21:26 zeal, and love for people continue to teach me
00:21:31 —and many others who knew him well— right down to this day.
00:21:35 So here is the question that rests before you:
00:21:40 What will you teach others by your example?
00:21:45 Be like Paul.
00:21:47 Love your brothers and sisters right from your heart.
00:21:51 Through your example,
00:21:53 create an atmosphere of warmth and love
00:21:57 like a greenhouse where young plants
00:22:00 can blossom and grow.
00:22:03 Your fine example can warm up a congregation,
00:22:07 a circuit, a Bethel department, perhaps even a branch office.
00:22:12 Never allow yourself
00:22:15 to be a cold executive
00:22:19 who creates an atmosphere like a freezer,
00:22:24 because those little plants
00:22:27 will shrivel up
00:22:29 and they will stop growing in that environment.
00:22:33 Yes, be willing to impart not just the many wonderful truths
00:22:37 of God’s Word that you learned at Gilead
00:22:39 but also your own heart and your own soul.
00:22:43 And then because those beautiful, spiritual people you work with
00:22:48 will be properly instructed,
00:22:51 what will they be like?
00:22:54 They will be just like you.
00:22:58 And may the blessing of our marvelous God, Jehovah,
00:23:01 go with you wherever you go.
00:23:11 Thank you very much, Brother Sanderson,
00:23:13 for that interesting Scriptural discussion
00:23:16 and some of those past experiences.
00:23:19 Of course, the brother might be saying,
00:23:21 ‘You should have paid closer attention to my talks.’
00:23:25 No, no.
00:23:27 It was obvious how much you loved him.
00:23:30 So, OK.
00:23:34 Clive Martin, a helper to the Writing Committee,
00:23:37 is going to address us now with this interesting theme,
00:23:41 “Remember the Terms of Peace?”
00:23:46 Have you ever had to sue for peace?
00:23:50 While you’re thinking of that question,
00:23:52 would you please turn with me to Luke chapter 14?
00:23:56 I’d like to put you and me
00:23:58 in the middle of one of Jesus’ illustrations.
00:24:01 Jesus has been talking about what it costs
00:24:05 to become one of his disciples.
00:24:07 And then in verse 31, he says:
00:24:11 “Or what king
00:24:13 “[this is where we come in, what king]
00:24:16 “marching out against another king in war
00:24:19 “does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with 10,000 troops
00:24:23 “to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20,000?
00:24:28 “If, in fact, he cannot do so,
00:24:30 “then while that one is yet far away,
00:24:34 he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace.”
00:24:41 How do you think that conversation goes?
00:24:45 “I want peace, and these are my terms.”
00:24:49 Hardly!
00:24:51 It’s more like: “I don’t want to be your enemy.
00:24:55 Please tell me what to do so that I can have peace with you.”
00:25:01 Now, with that in mind, Jesus gives the application, verse 33:
00:25:05 “In the same way, you may be sure that not one of you
00:25:10 “who does not say good-bye to all his belongings
00:25:14 can be my disciple.”
00:25:17 That is you and me.
00:25:19 We got to the point where we realized
00:25:21 we did not want to be an enemy of Jehovah.
00:25:24 And so we were willing to sacrifice everything
00:25:28 —belongings, career, status, everything—
00:25:32 for the privilege of being at peace with Jehovah
00:25:35 and being a disciple of his Son.
00:25:38 Now for you students of class 150,
00:25:41 your pursuit of peace with Jehovah
00:25:43 has led you into the special full-time service.
00:25:46 And what a beautiful record every one of you has set!
00:25:52 You remind me in many ways
00:25:55 of a group in the Bible
00:25:57 that literally sued for peace.
00:26:00 Their story is told in the book of Joshua chapter 9.
00:26:04 That’s right; we’re talking about the Gibeonites.
00:26:08 Do you have Joshua chapter 9?
00:26:11 Now, they had heard of all the things that Jehovah had done
00:26:14 for his people, Israel, and to his enemies.
00:26:19 They did not want to be Jehovah’s enemy.
00:26:21 And so they did exactly what the king in Jesus’ illustration did.
00:26:26 They sent a body of ambassadors.
00:26:29 So Joshua chapter 9
00:26:31 —and this is the opening overture
00:26:35 in verse 6:
00:26:39 “We have come from a distant land.
00:26:41 Now make a covenant with us.”
00:26:45 When they didn’t get a very warm initial reception, they persisted.
00:26:50 Verse 8: “We are your servants.”
00:26:54 In other words, “Set the terms; we want peace.”
00:26:59 They were willing to sacrifice everything
00:27:03 in order to enjoy peace with Israel and with Israel’s God.
00:27:08 Now, Joshua and the chieftains didn’t see it exactly the same way,
00:27:11 particularly when they found out
00:27:14 that they were not from a distant land as they had claimed.
00:27:17 Nobody likes to be fooled.
00:27:19 So the tone got a little sterner.
00:27:22 So turn and look at verse 23.
00:27:25 This is what they said: “From now on you are cursed,
00:27:29 “and you will always occupy a slave’s position
00:27:32 as gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”
00:27:38 What will the Gibeonites say to that?
00:27:41 Verse 25: “We are at your mercy.
00:27:45 Do to us whatever you think is good and right.”
00:27:51 And just so, the terms of peace were set.
00:27:54 Verse 27: “That day Joshua made them
00:27:58 “gatherers of wood and drawers of water
00:28:01 “for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar
00:28:03 “at the place that He should choose,
00:28:06 and they remain so to this day.”
00:28:09 So now a few questions, a few lessons.
00:28:13 What do you think of the Gibeonites’ assignment?
00:28:17 It was presented to them as a punishment.
00:28:20 But just think,
00:28:22 they weren’t being sold off as household slaves.
00:28:25 Their humble service would directly contribute
00:28:29 to pure worship and support Jehovah’s people.
00:28:34 That’s a privilege, isn’t it?
00:28:36 That’s the kind of service we reach out for as a privilege.
00:28:43 Now, the kind of service—
00:28:46 Was it because they were lowly people,
00:28:49 no skills to do anything else, that they were given this kind of job?
00:28:54 Well, look at chapter 10
00:28:57 and verse 2
00:29:00 and see the kind of people the Gibeonites were:
00:29:03 “Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities.
00:29:07 “It was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors
00:29:13 [capable, skilled people].”
00:29:16 However,
00:29:19 clearly the Gibeonites realized
00:29:21 that if their army was no match for Israel,
00:29:24 then Jehovah didn’t need them
00:29:27 to bolster his army in order to complete the conquest.
00:29:30 It was better for them
00:29:32 to ask Jehovah what he wanted them to do and to do that.
00:29:37 So the sacrifice was definitely worth it.
00:29:42 Does that mean, though, that their skills were irrelevant,
00:29:47 never even considered?
00:29:49 Well, no.
00:29:51 For example, a few hundred years later,
00:29:53 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite
00:29:55 is listed among David’s 30 mighty men.
00:29:59 Different needs call for different skills.
00:30:03 What did Ishmaiah do with his skill?
00:30:07 Well, he humbly defended pure worship and Jehovah’s people.
00:30:12 So the details of the assignment were different,
00:30:15 but the focus was about the same.
00:30:20 Another question: Was this just
00:30:23 a short-term starter assignment?
00:30:26 “Yes, we will do this for now, but once the campaign is over,
00:30:30 we’ll be able to resume our regular place in society.”
00:30:36 Go back to verse 27 of chapter 9.
00:30:39 Remember what Joshua said at this point
00:30:42 when he gave them their assignment?
00:30:44 “They remain so to this day.”
00:30:48 Not only to the day that Joshua wrote these words
00:30:53 but about 900 years later
00:30:56 among the exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem
00:31:00 to restore pure worship there were temple servants,
00:31:04 and likely
00:31:07 this included descendants of the Gibeonites.
00:31:10 Just think, these temple servants
00:31:13 once again were willing to leave behind the life that they’d built up
00:31:18 to make the trek in behalf of pure worship
00:31:21 and take up their duties.
00:31:23 They must have really cherished their assignment
00:31:27 in order to stick to it that way.
00:31:31 So as we’ve talked about them,
00:31:33 have you been noting some personal lessons?
00:31:36 These are the four that come to my mind.
00:31:40 Number one, as with the king
00:31:43 in Jesus’ illustration and the Gibeonites,
00:31:46 peace with Jehovah is such a treasure.
00:31:50 We’re willing to sacrifice anything to enjoy it.
00:31:55 Number two, Jehovah’s terms for us
00:31:58 include humble service
00:32:01 on behalf of pure worship and in support of his people,
00:32:05 and that kind of humble service
00:32:08 we view as the greatest privilege.
00:32:11 Number three, different needs call for different skills,
00:32:16 and that may lead to a change of assignment
00:32:20 for you or for someone else.
00:32:23 Either way, we don’t compete and we don’t compare.
00:32:26 The details of the assignment may be different,
00:32:29 but the focus, or goal, is always the same.
00:32:33 And the fourth one,
00:32:36 we cherish our assignments.
00:32:38 We’re going to stay in them as long as Jehovah allows.
00:32:43 In short, we cherish our assignments;
00:32:47 we love our God.
00:32:49 Peace with Jehovah is a treasure that we will never let go.
00:33:00 Thank you very much.
00:33:02 We appreciated that very much.
00:33:04 We’re now at peace, Brother Martin.
00:33:07 Thank you for those kind, encouraging thoughts.
00:33:10 Now, this is something special for you here in the class,
00:33:14 the 150th class of Gilead.
00:33:19 Now, you may be wondering about your post-graduation life.
00:33:24 You’ve probably been doing that at least a couple of weeks.
00:33:28 And how will you use what you’ve learned from Gilead
00:33:32 to strengthen and stabilize
00:33:34 the branch organization and others?
00:33:38 And Brother Sanderson touched on that,
00:33:41 and you’ll hear more later about that.
00:33:44 That’s our purpose.
00:33:46 Now, here’s a question to ponder.
00:33:48 What if you could look down the road
00:33:51 —let’s say 2, 4, 6,
00:33:54 or even 30 years
00:33:58 into the future from this day of graduation?
00:34:04 It’d be nice to be able to do.
00:34:06 Well, we’re pleased to inform you
00:34:08 that the Teaching Committee has included
00:34:11 at this graduation a special feature
00:34:14 in connection with this graduation.
00:34:17 It consists of four prerecorded interviews
00:34:21 of Gilead graduates currently in their assignments.
00:34:26 And all four of the brothers
00:34:28 are serving on Branch Committees;
00:34:31 they’re Branch Committee members.
00:34:33 So the interviews will begin now,
00:34:36 and then another will follow each of the next three parts of the program.
00:34:41 So we’ll have a part and then an interview.
00:34:44 Now, first, we’re going to travel to the country
00:34:47 of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
00:34:51 There we find a brother who graduated
00:34:53 from the 138th class of Gilead.
00:34:58 Listen as he explains how his Gilead training
00:35:02 has helped him to work humbly
00:35:04 with his fellow brothers and Branch Committee members.
00:35:08 Enjoy the video.
00:35:12 Brother and Sister Kabitshwa
00:35:14 will be returning to Congo.
00:35:16 It’s difficult
00:35:17 to find one word,
00:35:19 or expression,
00:35:20 that can sum up what I personally feel
00:35:23 after this training in Gilead.
00:35:25 The in-depth study of Jehovah’s personality
00:35:29 opened my eyes more fully
00:35:31 to the way he values people.
00:35:33 And this has helped me to look
00:35:36 for opportunities to strengthen others
00:35:39 by placing their interests above my own.
00:35:43 For example, my wife and I
00:35:45 made ourselves available to support the brothers
00:35:48 in cleaning a regional convention venue.
00:35:50 They laughed, thinking that we were joking.
00:35:53 And finally, they gave us
00:35:55 humble tasks in cleaning.
00:35:57 We did it with joy, and it allowed me
00:36:00 to get to know the brothers in the circuits better.
00:36:03 Taking these opportunities
00:36:05 has a much more profound effect on the brothers
00:36:08 than simply giving talks.
00:36:10 Gilead has also helped me
00:36:12 to show honor to the other members
00:36:15 of the Branch Committee.
00:36:17 On the committee I serve,
00:36:18 there are brothers of different age groups.
00:36:21 While I feel that my normal inclination
00:36:24 is to speak too much,
00:36:25 I have learned from others on the committee
00:36:27 how to humbly listen.
00:36:29 For example, I had to present a concept to the Branch Committee,
00:36:33 and I put all my heart into the presentation.
00:36:36 I was 100 percent sure it would be approved.
00:36:40 Guess what?
00:36:42 None of the options were approved.
00:36:44 Honestly, inside myself, I was upset and ready to give up.
00:36:49 What helped me was meditating on the example
00:36:52 of another fellow Branch Committee member
00:36:55 and how he reacted in times like this.
00:36:58 Thanks to Gilead, I have learned
00:37:00 to benefit from the qualities of each one of the brothers I work with,
00:37:05 no matter who they are or the experience they have.
00:37:09 Jehovah’s organization
00:37:11 is made up of people from different cultures and backgrounds,
00:37:16 and these differences can at times be to us
00:37:20 like a huge gap that threatens our unity.
00:37:24 In one of our lessons at Gilead,
00:37:28 Matthew 5:3 was used to show
00:37:30 that the only way to bridge the gap
00:37:34 is to be a spiritual person.
00:37:36 So every time I’m overwhelmed
00:37:39 by a feeling of inadequacy
00:37:42 or I’m about to vent my frustrations,
00:37:45 I reconnect to Jehovah and Jesus
00:37:48 by studying the Bible and praying for help.
00:37:51 I would definitely say that Gilead
00:37:53 has given me all the tools I need
00:37:56 to build the bridge of unity
00:37:58 among Jehovah’s people whenever I see a gap
00:38:01 —and that tool is to feed my own spirituality.
00:38:12 That was a nice addition for the program.
00:38:15 We look forward to the other videos.
00:38:17 Now, next, we have a helper to the Teaching Committee.
00:38:21 He’s been so for a long time.
00:38:23 I’m not picking on your age, Bill,
00:38:27 but you look good.
00:38:29 That’s because his wife, Sandy, is right out there,
00:38:31 so I try to be careful.
00:38:35 Now, we always look forward to what Brother Malenfant has
00:38:38 to share with us.
00:38:40 His theme is “‘Boast in Jehovah.’”
00:38:46 There are many people who love to boast.
00:38:51 Politicians frequently boast about what they have done
00:38:55 and what they have promised to do for their constituents.
00:38:58 And businessmen,
00:39:00 they love to boast about how successful they are
00:39:04 and how much money they are making.
00:39:07 And athletes, you know, athletes are prideful, many of them.
00:39:11 And they boast about the events
00:39:14 that they’ve been great in and that they’ve won.
00:39:16 In fact, you know, it’s interesting to note
00:39:20 that in the highly competitive sports world,
00:39:23 there is an expression for great achievers.
00:39:26 The expression is GOAT
00:39:30 —G-O-A-T—
00:39:33 greatest of all time.
00:39:36 Can you imagine people thinking
00:39:38 that somehow they have been the greatest of all time?
00:39:42 When we hear the words “greatest of all time,”
00:39:46 only one person comes to mind.
00:39:49 He was the greatest man who ever lived
00:39:51 —truly the greatest of all time, Jesus Christ.
00:39:55 And his greatness had nothing to do
00:39:58 with politics, business,
00:40:02 or playing games.
00:40:04 But it had everything to do
00:40:07 with praising Jehovah and boasting
00:40:11 in Jehovah God.
00:40:13 Jesus knew the counsel that’s recorded
00:40:16 at Jeremiah chapter 9,
00:40:19 verses 23, 24.
00:40:22 And this scripture, this text, is beautiful.
00:40:25 Jeremiah 9:23, 24
00:40:28 —it says:
00:40:30 “This is what Jehovah says:
00:40:33 “‘Let not the wise man boast about his wisdom;
00:40:38 “‘let not the mighty man boast about his mightiness;
00:40:42 “‘and let not the rich man boast about his riches.
00:40:47 “‘But let the one boasting
00:40:50 “‘boast about this:
00:40:52 “‘That he has insight and knowledge of me,
00:40:56 “‘that I am Jehovah,
00:40:59 “‘the One showing loyal love,
00:41:02 “‘justice, and righteousness in the earth,
00:41:06 “‘for in these things
00:41:08 I take delight,’ declares Jehovah.”
00:41:12 Isn’t that beautiful?
00:41:14 So to boast in Jehovah really means
00:41:16 that we take pride in our God, Jehovah.
00:41:19 We’re proud to bear his name.
00:41:21 We rejoice in his reputation.
00:41:24 We’ve got it in the Scriptures, and we can see it
00:41:27 in the organization today.
00:41:30 And Jehovah takes delight when we boast in him
00:41:34 —in his provisions, in his justice,
00:41:38 in his promises, and in his loyal love.
00:41:42 So you students of the 150th class of Gilead
00:41:47 (students, soon-to-be graduates, I should add),
00:41:50 you’ve got a lot of reasons to boast in Jehovah God.
00:41:55 And you know that throughout his ministry, Jesus boasted in Jehovah.
00:41:59 If you examine closely the Scriptures and things that Jesus said,
00:42:03 you’ll be able to see on many occasions
00:42:06 how he boasted in Jehovah.
00:42:08 Just to give you one example,
00:42:10 remember when the rich young ruler approached Jesus and he said:
00:42:14 “[Oh,] Good Teacher” to the Lord Jesus Christ?
00:42:17 And what did Jesus say?
00:42:19 “Why do you call me good?
00:42:23 Nobody is good except one, God.”
00:42:27 That was a wonderful boast
00:42:30 in Jehovah God, glorifying him.
00:42:33 So you students can boast in Jehovah
00:42:35 (you’ve been doing it for a long time)
00:42:37 because now you have
00:42:40 the privilege of going out, fulfilling an assignment,
00:42:43 and showing how much you really do rely on Jehovah God.
00:42:48 You can boast because you’ve experienced what Jesus declared
00:42:52 at John 8:32.
00:42:55 Jesus said: “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
00:42:59 Well, that’s something we all know.
00:43:01 But don’t minimize it.
00:43:04 Appreciate the freedom you have right now
00:43:07 because you know the truth.
00:43:10 You’ve been set free from the lies of this world
00:43:13 that hold people in bondage about false beliefs in life and death.
00:43:18 You’re free from human thinking that man
00:43:20 is going to remedy the problems of this old world,
00:43:23 and we know they can’t do it.
00:43:25 They haven’t got the wherewithal to do it.
00:43:27 No man can really “direct his [own steps],” not even a perfect man.
00:43:32 Jehovah can deliver his people too.
00:43:36 Even where we’re under severe persecution,
00:43:40 Jehovah can intervene whenever he sees fit to do so.
00:43:45 You can boast also in another thing —that you are slaves of Jehovah.
00:43:49 Now, you’re in a unique position because very few slaves
00:43:52 are allowed to choose their master,
00:43:55 but you’ve done it.
00:43:57 You’ve chosen Jehovah God
00:43:59 to be your Master and to be a slave to him.
00:44:02 And you know that Jehovah is with you.
00:44:05 And you’re happy, and you’re willing slaves of Jehovah and of Jesus Christ.
00:44:10 And it’s a remarkable slavery, really,
00:44:13 because no one has the freedom
00:44:16 that we enjoy in our slavery to Jehovah God.
00:44:19 We’re so free and able to do so many things
00:44:23 serving Jehovah but all the while
00:44:26 enjoying the good life that God has given to us.
00:44:31 You can boast also in the brotherhood,
00:44:33 that you can gather together in assemblies to praise Jehovah God.
00:44:37 And you know Jesus’ words are true:
00:44:39 ‘Two or three are gathered in his name.
00:44:41 There he is in our midst.’
00:44:43 So whether it’s tens of thousands gathered together at a big convention
00:44:48 or two or three gathering together secretly,
00:44:52 you know that Jesus Christ is there with you.
00:44:56 You can also boast in the great privilege you have through prayer.
00:44:59 Just think about it for a moment.
00:45:01 You can talk to the almighty Creator of the universe personally.
00:45:06 That is really something quite remarkable.
00:45:09 But that is a privilege we have,
00:45:11 and we boast in the privilege we have
00:45:13 of addressing Jehovah and asking him for his help,
00:45:17 for his spirit to guide us, for his strength and protection.
00:45:21 And there’s something else too that I find fascinating
00:45:23 that you can boast in.
00:45:26 You can boast because you bear
00:45:28 the fear-inspiring name Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:45:32 Think about that.
00:45:34 You’re carrying Jehovah’s name.
00:45:37 And how grateful, really, we are that back in 1931
00:45:42 the visible part of Jehovah’s organization
00:45:44 adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses!
00:45:48 And it’s not just the name of a religion.
00:45:51 It’s a description of what people do.
00:45:54 They live their lives to honor Jehovah God.
00:45:57 They are living Witnesses of the Creator.
00:46:01 That is a privilege that we have,
00:46:03 and that separates us from all religion on the earth.
00:46:06 And there’s no other religion that wants that name anyhow.
00:46:09 But we’re delighted that we have it.
00:46:13 And they regret, perhaps a few, that they didn’t listen to or adopt it.
00:46:19 We are God’s name people, and at 1 Chronicles 16:10,
00:46:24 it says this: “Boast about his holy name.
00:46:28 Let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.”
00:46:32 And if you examine synonyms,
00:46:35 “rejoice” is a synonym in certain cases
00:46:38 for “boast”—to boast in Jehovah.
00:46:42 And you can boast over the fact that Jehovah
00:46:45 has allowed you a very special privilege.
00:46:48 You can see the unseen.
00:46:52 Not all people can do that.
00:46:54 The vision of many people in this world
00:46:56 is limited to just the physical that they see before them,
00:47:00 but they can’t see the unseen.
00:47:02 I remember a man who said,
00:47:05 “What has God ever done for me?”
00:47:08 That poor man.
00:47:09 He was blind—totally blind spiritually.
00:47:13 He enjoyed food, drink, the things the earth provides,
00:47:17 but he couldn’t see behind those physical things.
00:47:20 He couldn’t see that there had to be a wonderful Creator
00:47:24 who provided all of these things for him.
00:47:29 You can see the unseen.
00:47:32 You see Jesus Christ ruling as King in the heavens.
00:47:36 You see the new world that’s coming.
00:47:38 You see the resurrection of the dead.
00:47:40 You see the functioning of Jehovah God’s holy spirit
00:47:44 on his people today.
00:47:47 Finally, you know very well
00:47:50 that we’ve only touched on a few things that you can boast in,
00:47:54 but you’ll want to continue doing that —boasting in Jehovah.
00:47:58 And right now, I know (all of you students) you feel great.
00:48:01 You’ve completed your course. You’ve done it.
00:48:04 You’re graduating from Gilead School,
00:48:06 and now the doors of future activity
00:48:09 are swinging open to you.
00:48:12 So as you undertake your assignments,
00:48:16 whatever and wherever they may be,
00:48:20 do these things, please:
00:48:22 Stay humble,
00:48:24 be happy,
00:48:27 and work hard.
00:48:29 And always esteem highly
00:48:31 the great honor and privilege you have
00:48:34 to “boast in Jehovah.”
00:48:45 Thanks.
00:48:47 Thanks, Bill.
00:48:48 As usual, we thoroughly enjoyed your talk.
00:48:52 Now, our second prerecorded interview
00:48:55 of a Gilead graduate now in his assignment
00:48:59 takes us to Ecuador, South America.
00:49:03 This brother serves on the Branch Committee in Ecuador,
00:49:06 and he graduated from the 142nd class of Gilead.
00:49:12 Notice as he explains
00:49:14 (notice) the positive impact
00:49:16 that Gilead graduates had on him
00:49:19 from his childhood
00:49:21 and how his training while at Gilead
00:49:23 helped him to appreciate what is truly important.
00:49:30 Brother and Sister Tapia will be going back to Ecuador.
00:49:35 Gilead training is a beautiful way
00:49:37 that Jehovah is using divine education
00:49:39 to train people
00:49:41 —not only for their benefit.
00:49:43 By having Gilead graduates
00:49:45 all around the world,
00:49:46 we are sharing the impact of this school
00:49:49 on the brothers and sisters who are working
00:49:51 with these students and future graduates.
00:49:54 It was Gilead missionaries
00:49:55 who first introduced the truth to my parents
00:49:58 and helped them to the point of baptism.
00:50:00 So I have very pleasant memories
00:50:03 of Gilead graduates being around my home since childhood.
00:50:07 The greatest legacy I received through my Gilead training
00:50:10 is the privilege of getting to know
00:50:12 Jehovah’s beautiful personality more deeply.
00:50:15 I have been studying the Bible since childhood,
00:50:18 but doing so with the help of the Gilead instructors
00:50:21 really helped me to make connections
00:50:24 that I had never put together before.
00:50:26 You don’t go to Gilead to learn abilities,
00:50:29 which can sometimes overshadow spiritual qualities.
00:50:32 Instead, a very important part of Gilead training
00:50:36 is the study of Christ’s personality.
00:50:39 And you know, Jesus is mostly remembered
00:50:41 not so much for his abilities
00:50:43 but for how he perfectly reflected
00:50:46 the beautiful qualities of his father.
00:50:48 By getting to know Jehovah and Jesus better,
00:50:51 I was able to better see where I need to improve.
00:50:55 Of course, it can be discouraging at times
00:50:58 to not always act as they do,
00:51:00 but that has helped me
00:51:01 to have the proper perspective and to rely on Jehovah,
00:51:05 begging him for his guidance while waiting for his help.
00:51:08 One of the best lessons I took away from Gilead is
00:51:12 that people are more important than tasks or deadlines.
00:51:17 People are the reason for our assignment,
00:51:21 and that is why I need to show my love to my brothers and sisters.
00:51:24 Honestly, I don’t feel at all qualified for this assignment,
00:51:29 but I have learned that if Jehovah assigns us a certain task,
00:51:32 for sure he will give us what we need to accomplish it.
00:51:42 That was very nice.
00:51:43 We certainly appreciate it.
00:51:45 Now, we have one of the Gilead instructors next,
00:51:49 Brother James Cauthon.
00:51:53 And he’s chosen as his subject
00:51:55 “Thriving in the Trenches.”
00:51:59 Located in the western Pacific Ocean,
00:52:04 the Mariana Trench is the deepest known location on earth.
00:52:09 To help you get an idea of its depth,
00:52:12 imagine that you could stack
00:52:14 the Empire State Building
00:52:15 in the trench.
00:52:17 It would take 25 such buildings to go
00:52:21 from the bottom of the trench before you would reach sea level.
00:52:26 It is also one of the deadliest places on earth.
00:52:30 Why is that?
00:52:31 In a word—pressure.
00:52:34 The crushing pressure, water pressure,
00:52:37 on the floor of the trench is more than eight tons per square inch.
00:52:41 Now, to give you some idea,
00:52:43 that would be the equivalent
00:52:44 of having about 50 jumbo jets
00:52:48 on top of you.
00:52:51 Surely no life could live in that trench.
00:52:55 At least that’s what scientists thought.
00:52:58 But they were wrong.
00:53:00 When they finally developed a submersible
00:53:02 that would take them down into the trench,
00:53:05 they found life teeming
00:53:09 —and not just surviving but thriving.
00:53:13 Now, how is that possible?
00:53:17 It’s possible, friends, because Jehovah, our Creator,
00:53:21 knows how to deal with pressure.
00:53:25 Jehovah knows how to deal with pressure.
00:53:28 And this is a fact that should be comforting to all of us.
00:53:32 Why?
00:53:33 Because the pressure
00:53:36 in this system of things is increasing
00:53:38 —strain, stress, anxiety—
00:53:41 for all people at all levels.
00:53:43 And the Bible tells us
00:53:45 that these pressures are likely to increase in the near future.
00:53:49 But the good news is
00:53:51 that Jehovah does more than just equip his servants to survive.
00:53:55 He can actually make one thrive.
00:53:59 Here’s an example.
00:54:01 Try this on for pressure.
00:54:05 You’re surrounded by men who hate you.
00:54:08 In addition to hunting you down with a view to taking your life,
00:54:12 they’ve spread slander and lies about you everywhere.
00:54:16 Your name has become a reproach.
00:54:20 When people see you coming, they turn and run the other way
00:54:24 because they feel that your time is short
00:54:26 and they don’t want to be caught in the crosshairs.
00:54:31 Wherever you look, it seems like terror is waiting for you.
00:54:35 And as a result of these problems, you’re struggling with depression.
00:54:40 Your own sins are staring you in the face.
00:54:42 The whole experience has taken a toll on your health.
00:54:45 You can’t sleep.
00:54:46 Your stamina is shot.
00:54:48 Your body is wasting away.
00:54:52 Now, that was David’s situation,
00:54:55 and you can read about it at Psalm 31:10-13.
00:55:01 The pressure was real —no question about it.
00:55:04 David’s feelings were real —no question about that.
00:55:09 But something else was very real.
00:55:12 And that was Jehovah.
00:55:15 And so Jehovah was where David would turn to.
00:55:20 Let’s turn to his words in Psalm 31.
00:55:26 Psalm 31—and note his humble prayer
00:55:30 beginning in verse 14.
00:55:33 He said: “But I trust in you, O Jehovah,
00:55:37 “I declare: ‘You are my God.’
00:55:40 “My days are in your hand.
00:55:42 “Rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those persecuting me.
00:55:46 “Make your face shine upon your servant.
00:55:49 Save me by your loyal love.”
00:55:54 David’s life experiences
00:55:57 had taught him the value of turning to God
00:56:00 and pouring out his heart in times of trial.
00:56:03 And he absolutely knew that prayer,
00:56:07 coupled with implicit trust and patience,
00:56:11 would always bring Jehovah’s blessing.
00:56:14 And you see, friends, the key to not just surviving
00:56:19 but thriving under extreme pressure
00:56:22 is to have the internal pressure
00:56:25 equal to the external.
00:56:28 And when this is true,
00:56:30 there is no amount of pressure that can crush you.
00:56:35 So in a spiritual sense,
00:56:37 David received the internal fortitude or, as some say,
00:56:41 “the intestinal fortitude,”
00:56:44 meaning “the courage and the strength
00:56:46 that would make him equal to the pressure weighing in on him.”
00:56:50 And how do we know that he received that?
00:56:53 Well, let’s go back to Psalm 31 for just a moment.
00:56:57 If you look in verse 21, notice now
00:57:01 the change.
00:57:03 He says: “May Jehovah be praised,
00:57:06 “for in a wonderful way, he has shown his loyal love to me
00:57:11 in a besieged city.”
00:57:13 And then in verse 23:
00:57:15 “Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!
00:57:19 Jehovah protects the faithful.”
00:57:21 And finally in verse 24:
00:57:23 “Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,
00:57:26 all you who are waiting for Jehovah.”
00:57:32 So, you see, David
00:57:36 received an answer to his prayer
00:57:39 —his prayer coupled with his faith
00:57:43 and his patience.
00:57:45 He was waiting on Jehovah.
00:57:47 And Jehovah helped him not only to survive but to thrive.
00:57:52 And he added joy to David
00:57:55 because David went on to find joy and happiness
00:57:59 in his responsibilities and privileges.
00:58:03 So, what do we learn?
00:58:05 (1) David was able to face the pressure
00:58:09 because he had an unshakable faith in Jehovah,
00:58:13 (2) David’s relationship with Jehovah
00:58:17 brought him the patience to wait on God,
00:58:21 and (3) when a loyal servant of God
00:58:25 humbly turns to Jehovah for help,
00:58:27 it is Jehovah’s own loyal love
00:58:30 that has the effect of equalizing the pressure.
00:58:35 And, you know, there’s something else.
00:58:38 David’s experience in the trench  reached further than he ever knew.
00:58:44 Jonah, while in the belly of the great fish,
00:58:48 cited words from Psalm 31.
00:58:52 Jeremiah, who had many trialsome times in his life,
00:58:57 often echoed phrases from Psalm 31.
00:59:01 And Jesus Christ himself, the very Son of God—
00:59:06 His final words from the stake
00:59:08 were a quotation from Psalm 31:5.
00:59:12 So Jesus must have meditated on this many times.
00:59:15 And so, friends, like David, Jonah, Jeremiah,
00:59:19 Jesus, and many, many others
00:59:22 —they all trusted in Jehovah,
00:59:24 and Jehovah never failed to make them equal to the pressure.
00:59:29 He’ll do the same for you.
00:59:32 And so in conclusion,
00:59:34 you see, it really doesn’t matter
00:59:38 how great the pressure is.
00:59:40 It only matters where the pressure lies.
00:59:43 Do not let it come between you
00:59:47 and Jehovah and your worship and service.
00:59:51 Don’t let it come between you,
00:59:53 because then the external pressure
00:59:56 will only continue to move you closer
01:00:00 to your heavenly Father.
01:00:03 The life that flourishes in the Mariana Trench gives
01:00:07 a positive example, a beautiful example,
01:00:10 of Jehovah’s limitless ability to help his creation
01:00:13 deal with pressure.
01:00:15 Prayer, trust, and patience
01:00:17 will always be rewarded by Jehovah.
01:00:21 Relief will come.
01:00:24 So remain close to your heavenly Father,
01:00:27 and you will not just survive
01:00:30 the pressure in the trench
01:00:33 but you will thrive spiritually.
01:00:42 Thank you, Brother Cauthon, for your nice, insightful comments
01:00:47 —much appreciated.
01:00:49 Now, our third interview involves a brother
01:00:51 who serves as a member of the Branch Committee
01:00:54 in Sri Lanka.
01:00:56 He graduated from the 146th class of Gilead
01:01:01 —so just four classes back.
01:01:04 Listen carefully as he explains
01:01:06 how Gilead training helped him to see things about his personality
01:01:11 that he needed to refine
01:01:14 to become a stabilizing and strengthening influence
01:01:18 in his branch territory.
01:01:22 Brother and Sister Sivakumaran will be returning to Sri Lanka.
01:01:28 In Gilead, the wonderful thing
01:01:30 is that you get to learn from the beginning
01:01:32 Jehovah’s dealings with humankind,
01:01:34 that vast history.
01:01:36 Learning that is humbling.
01:01:39 How tiny I am
01:01:41 and the small role that I play
01:01:43 in Jehovah’s organization are a realization!
01:01:45 Before going to Gilead, I thought I was a loving person,
01:01:50 because we always think we want to be loving people.
01:01:53 But during Gilead, it was made aware to me
01:01:56 that I had a spiritual blind spot.
01:01:59 There were brothers and sisters that I didn’t really notice before,
01:02:04 and that kind of taught me an important lesson.
01:02:07 It’s not about giving talks,
01:02:10 but really it’s personal attention that brothers need.
01:02:15 So I need to give them my time,
01:02:17 and I need to help them understand
01:02:19 that Jehovah loves them very much.
01:02:22 You know, one word that stands out throughout the training is “mercy.”
01:02:27 Israel made many mistakes,
01:02:29 but Jehovah never picked on them for their mistakes.
01:02:31 He just wanted them to come back to him, and that was a lovely lesson.
01:02:35 As an overseer, I need to ask a question that always,
01:02:39 you know, rings in my my ear,
01:02:41 ‘Am I going to criticize, or am I going to commend?’
01:02:45 Just to give you an example, before going to Gilead,
01:02:48 as a home overseer I was strict
01:02:52 and came across stingy, to be honest.
01:02:55 But during Gilead, it was made well aware to me
01:02:58 that I need to change.
01:03:00 I need to be more generous,
01:03:02 and I need to be merciful.
01:03:04 I vividly remember that one instructor said:
01:03:07 “Saying no to everything can be addictive,
01:03:11 and it makes for an easy way out.”
01:03:13 But we were admonished to say yes whenever we can
01:03:18 and to help the brothers.
01:03:20 Summing up Gilead, I can’t do better than Jesus.
01:03:24 Love Jehovah; love people
01:03:27 —that’s the whole training of Gilead.
01:03:29 And some of my feelings
01:03:31 every time I think about Gilead
01:03:36 are that I have a long way to go to put all those details into practice
01:03:40 and to change myself to fit Jehovah.
01:03:43 So, yeah, I have a long way to go, so I’m working on it.
01:03:53 So we pray that all of you soon-to-be graduates
01:03:58 examine yourself to ensure
01:04:01 that you’ll have a strengthening effect on the brotherhood.
01:04:05 It was nice, the humble expressions he shared with us.
01:04:08 Now let’s turn our attention to another one of the Gilead instructors
01:04:12 and a helper to the Teaching Committee, Mark Noumair.
01:04:16 The title of his talk is
01:04:19 “‘I Cling to You; You Hold on to Me.’”
01:04:24 Brother Noumair.
01:04:28 In this talk, we want you to understand
01:04:32 the sustaining power of loyal love.
01:04:37 Because it is this quality, loyal love,
01:04:40 and its power
01:04:42 that will help you face future trials
01:04:46 and challenges with confidence in Jehovah.
01:04:50 Well, you perhaps remember the definition
01:04:53 of loyal love from a written review.
01:04:56 But it’s this: It is love motivated
01:05:00 by a strong commitment and a deep attachment.
01:05:04 And here’s how King David described
01:05:06 the loyal love that existed between him and Jehovah.
01:05:11 He said at Psalm 63:8:
01:05:14 “I cling to you;
01:05:16 your right hand keeps fast hold on me.”
01:05:20 Now, this is loyal love,
01:05:23 ‘I cling to you.
01:05:25 You hold on to me.’
01:05:28 Now, in the first century —a woman—
01:05:30 a woman who set an outstanding example
01:05:33 of clinging to Jehovah is Anna.
01:05:37 How so? Let’s find out.
01:05:40 We open our Bibles to Luke chapter 2.
01:05:43 We’re going to read verses 36 and 37
01:05:46 and see what lesson we can learn and apply to you:
01:05:53 “Now there was a prophetess,
01:05:55 “Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of Asher’s tribe.
01:05:58 “This woman was well along in years
01:06:01 “and had lived with her husband for seven years after they were married,
01:06:05 “and she was a widow now 84 years old.
01:06:09 “She was never missing from the temple,
01:06:11 “rendering sacred service night and day
01:06:14 with fasting and supplications.”
01:06:17 Well, here we have it.
01:06:19 Everything we know about Anna is right here.
01:06:23 Luke recorded it.
01:06:25 She was 84 years old
01:06:28 when Luke introduces her to us.
01:06:31 Likely, she hadn’t lived long enough to become a follower of Jesus,
01:06:36 to be anointed with holy spirit,
01:06:39 or to enjoy preaching the good news of the Kingdom.
01:06:42 That’s it.
01:06:44 If  we stop right there.
01:06:47 But what if we don’t?
01:06:49 What if we dig deeper?
01:06:52 What will we learn that will help you?
01:06:55 Well, let’s do that.
01:06:57 Anna was born about 86 B.C.E.
01:07:03 When she was 23 years old,
01:07:06 Jerusalem was filled with violence and divisions.
01:07:10 Jewish leaders such as the Maccabees are at war.
01:07:13 Roman forces under the leadership of a soldier named Pompey
01:07:17 came to restore order, and in the process,
01:07:20 some 12,000 Jews reportedly died.
01:07:24 It is possible that Anna’s husband
01:07:28 was one of these victims.
01:07:31 Then when Anna was 47 years old,
01:07:34 the Romans appointed Herod as king of Judea.
01:07:37 Herod?
01:07:39 This man was not a descendant of David.
01:07:41 He was not even an Israelite.
01:07:43 He was an Edomite.
01:07:45 The Edomites were sworn enemies of true worship.
01:07:49 Now, on top of that, the hypocritical Jewish religious leaders
01:07:54 made life hard for people, including widows like Anna.
01:07:59 So now Anna watches as Jehovah’s “house of prayer,”
01:08:03 the place she cherished, became “a cave of robbers.”
01:08:08 Pure worship is withering on the vine.
01:08:12 What will Anna do?
01:08:14 She could have been stumbled.
01:08:16 She could have reasoned: ‘I supported true worship all my life.
01:08:21 ‘I believed the Messiah would come and the prophecies would come.
01:08:25 ‘I go to the temple every day.
01:08:27 ‘I’ve done everything right, but things have only gotten worse.
01:08:31 ‘God let my husband die; an Edomite is rebuilding the temple.
01:08:36 ‘What’s happening?
01:08:38 ‘Has Jehovah left us?
01:08:40 Should I leave too?’
01:08:43 Anna could have given up, walked away, became bitter.
01:08:46 But she didn’t.
01:08:48 Why? Why?
01:08:51 It was the roots of her loyal love,
01:08:54 that sustaining power of loyal love.
01:08:56 It went deep, and it wrapped around Jehovah.
01:09:00 And she had the power to keep clinging to him
01:09:03 under those circumstances.
01:09:05 Anna was determined to serve Jehovah to the best of her ability.
01:09:10 What did she do?
01:09:11 Again, looking at verse 37:
01:09:15 “She was never missing from the temple,
01:09:19 “[She was in the right place.]
01:09:23 “rendering sacred service night and day
01:09:26 “[doing the right thing]
01:09:29 “with fasting and supplications
01:09:31 [with the right attitude].”
01:09:34 She was doing the right thing
01:09:37 in the right place with the right attitude.
01:09:41 Nothing could stop this seemingly fragile servant of God
01:09:45 from clinging to her closest Friend, Jehovah.
01:09:49 In effect, Anna was saying,
01:09:52 “I cling to you, Jehovah.”
01:09:56 And her loyal love was noticed.
01:10:00 Chapter 2 and verse 38
01:10:03 reveals that Anna was present
01:10:06 when the baby Jesus was brought to the temple.
01:10:10 And when she saw that baby, what did she begin to do in verse 38?
01:10:15 It says: “She came near and [she] began giving thanks to God
01:10:19 “and speaking about the child to all who were waiting
01:10:22 for Jerusalem’s deliverance.”
01:10:25 Can you sense her joy?
01:10:27 Can you feel the joy she had at seeing and, perhaps, even holding
01:10:31 that little baby, the future Messiah?
01:10:33 This was something that this elderly woman
01:10:36 had never expected in her lifetime.
01:10:40 The child in front of her was proof
01:10:43 —tangible proof, concrete evidence—
01:10:46 that Jehovah had not abandoned his people.
01:10:51 And he did not abandon Anna.
01:10:55 So not only had Anna clung to Jehovah
01:10:59 but Jehovah held on to her and
01:11:04 —and  rewarded her.
01:11:08 This is loyal love.
01:11:12 Anna’s faithful record
01:11:15 is so well-known
01:11:18 that some 50 years later,
50 years later or so,
01:11:22 Luke was compelled to write about her.
01:11:25 Where did he get his information?
01:11:28 Who did he talk to?
01:11:29 Did he talk to Mary or interview her or some of the older ones?
01:11:33 ‘There was this woman, Anna. She was at the temple.
01:11:35 She would never leave.’
01:11:37 We don’t know.
01:11:39 But what we do know is that Jehovah inspired Luke
01:11:44 to record and to document her life in His Word
01:11:48 so that we could be taught lessons.
01:11:52 And here we are some 2,000 years later,
01:11:55 and we are using her life as an example
01:11:59 of commitment and unbreakable integrity
01:12:02 for you students to imitate.
01:12:06 So, what can you learn from Anna’s example?
01:12:12 You may suffer loss of one kind or another.
01:12:15 You will come face-to-face with the imperfections of others.
01:12:19 Your feelings may get hurt,
01:12:22 you might find yourself coping with an unexpected change
01:12:25 in your life that is not pleasant,
01:12:28 or you may feel that you’re a victim
01:12:31 of an injustice or a serious misunderstanding
01:12:34 from within the organization.
01:12:37 What will you do?
01:12:39 This is what you will do.
01:12:42 You will cling to Jehovah,
01:12:44 and you will experience him holding on to you.
01:12:47 You cling to him.
01:12:49 He holds on to you.
01:12:51 For example,
01:12:53 I recall a time when a brother serving in a foreign field
01:12:57 because of a misunderstanding lost his privileges as an elder.
01:13:02 And he felt the decision was unfair.
01:13:04 He was deeply hurt.
01:13:06 But his wife— He and his wife never stopped clinging to Jehovah
01:13:11 and their spiritual routine.
01:13:14 Then at a regional convention,
01:13:16 a brother approached him and thanked him for the talk
01:13:19 that he gave on the program.
01:13:22 Well, he volunteered in the cleaning department,
01:13:24 but he hadn’t given a talk.
01:13:27 Then the brother now said to this former elder:
01:13:30 “When I see your smile and positive attitude,
01:13:34 “yes, you gave a talk.
01:13:37 “And it was on loyalty,
01:13:39 and it was loud and clear.”
01:13:43 So the former elder now relates this:
01:13:45 “The experience taught me and my wife
01:13:48 “that every challenge or misfortune
01:13:50 “does not need to represent a threat
01:13:53 “to our spiritual well-being.
01:13:57 “We’ve come to view rejection, failure,
01:13:59 “or being misunderstood as normal episodes
01:14:02 “in the lives of competent, healthy people.
01:14:06 Instead of being crushed, we grew.”
01:14:10 You see, the couple looked beyond their hardships,
01:14:15 and they clung to Jehovah.
01:14:17 How?
01:14:19 By imitating Anna.
01:14:22 They were ‘never missing from true worship
01:14:26 ‘[in the right place],
01:14:29 ‘rendering sacred service day and night
01:14:33 ‘[doing the right thing]
01:14:35 with fasting and supplications.’
01:14:37 And sometimes those supplications involve tears
01:14:42 but with the right attitude.
01:14:45 And Jehovah held on to them and never let go.
01:14:50 The brother is still serving in the foreign field.
01:14:53 He is an elder again
01:14:55 and giving memorable talks.
01:15:00 So, what do we want you to remember from this talk?
01:15:06 We want you to remember this:
01:15:09 When you come face-to-face with future trials (and you will)
01:15:14 or challenges in your life (and you will, this is what happens in life),
01:15:22 be in the right place,
01:15:25 do the right thing
01:15:28 with the right attitude.
01:15:30 By doing this, you declare:
01:15:33 “Jehovah, I cling to you,
01:15:36 and I trust you to hold on to me.”
01:15:47 Thank you very much, Brother Noumair.
01:15:50 Anna is a beautiful example for all of us.
01:15:53 No doubt about it.
01:15:55 Now, our final prerecorded interview takes us
01:16:00 to the West African country of Ghana,
01:16:03 where David and Lynne Jones currently serve.
01:16:07 Upon their graduation from the 95th class
01:16:11 in September of 1993,
01:16:14 they were assigned to the country of Kenya, East Africa.
01:16:17 They also served in Burundi for eight years.
01:16:21 Presently, they serve in Ghana,
01:16:23 where Brother Jones serves as a member of the Branch Committee there.
01:16:28 Now, you might remember this couple when you see the video
01:16:32 because their class was highlighted
01:16:34 in the video To the Ends of the Earth,
01:16:38 which marked the 50th anniversary
01:16:40 of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.
01:16:43 It was a very enlightening video for sure.
01:16:48 Although the purpose of Gilead School training
01:16:51 has changed since then,
01:16:53 it’s clear from their heartfelt comments
01:16:57 that they’ve proven to be a stabilizing and strengthening influence
01:17:02 where they have served.
01:17:04 So enjoy the video.
01:17:09 This is the day when we hand out assignments
01:17:12 to all of these students.
01:17:13 The morning that we knew we were going to get our assignment,
01:17:15 we went down to morning worship,
01:17:17 and then we had to line up, and we were waiting to get our assignment.
01:17:21 And my stomach was churning, and I felt really sick
01:17:25 —sick with excitement as well as the fact that you knew
01:17:28 that whatever Brother Jaracz said,
01:17:30 the next sentence that came out of his mouth
01:17:32 would determine the rest of your life.
01:17:36 It’s hard to imagine
01:17:38 that 28 years have gone by
01:17:40 since our initial assignment.
01:17:41 But Gilead training really helped us
01:17:44 to understand that things
01:17:45 wouldn’t always be easy.
01:17:47 And that when things weren’t easy,
01:17:49 we should never overreact to situations
01:17:51 but keep calm and trust in Jehovah.
01:17:53 I think one of the outstanding sections of Gilead for me
01:17:57 was the section dealing with the Gospels and Jesus Christ.
01:18:01 Jesus was always kind.
01:18:03 He was always reasonable in his dealings with people.
01:18:07 And so in class, the emphasis was, not on head knowledge,
01:18:11 but on how we can imitate Jesus Christ in our dealings with others.
01:18:16 And I remember a couple of phrases:
01:18:18 People over productivity.
01:18:21 And the kind thing is always the right thing to do.
01:18:24 These lessons are still with me all these years later.
01:18:27 We were taught how to study.
01:18:30 And it helped us to study in a way
01:18:34 that would build a pool or a foundation of principles
01:18:38 so that when we had a trial,
01:18:40 we would have somewhere to go and dip into that pool of principles
01:18:44 that would apply to any situation that we might face.
01:18:47 And it’s true that at the time you go through it,
01:18:49 you’re taking in all the knowledge.
01:18:52 You don’t know when and where you’re going to use it,
01:18:54 but it teaches you the method of:
01:18:56 Let’s store all this in the bank, and then when I need it,
01:18:59 I know where I can go and pick it from.
01:19:01 One example that comes to mind
01:19:04 is a lecture we had that highlighted Romans 15:3,
01:19:09 where it talked about how “even the Christ did not please himself.”
01:19:13 So thinking about that lecture makes me think of a situation
01:19:17 when we had been field missionaries for a couple of years.
01:19:20 We were invited to go into the traveling work.
01:19:23 So I was thinking to myself,
01:19:26 ‘Can I really do this?’
01:19:28 But then I reflected back on that lecture
01:19:31 —Romans 15:3: “The Christ [didn’t] please himself.”
01:19:34 It’s not about me.
01:19:35 It’s about doing Jehovah’s will.
01:19:37 It’s about the people you serve.
01:19:39 Reflecting on that helped me
01:19:40 to see myself in that big picture and realize,
01:19:43 ‘No, if Jesus could do that, then this is what I have to do first
01:19:47 —I put the brothers and sisters first.’
01:19:49 And we thoroughly enjoyed being in that circuit.
01:19:52 I don’t even know why I was so worried.
01:19:54 Because at the end of three years, we didn’t even want to leave.
01:20:00 The impact of Gilead is not fully appreciated in the moment.
01:20:04 But as the years have gone by,
01:20:06 I do find myself reflecting on the lessons
01:20:10 that were taught during that class.
01:20:13 And I see how it’s shaped
01:20:15 the way I think and feel all these years later.
01:20:19 So I would say, yeah,
01:20:20 it’s had a life- or personality-changing effect on me.
01:20:27 When I think back of standing in that line,
01:20:30 I mean, it is very vivid
01:20:32 in my memory of how I felt.
01:20:35 And my stomach was definitely churning.
01:20:38 But these 28 years, I have not regretted one single minute of it.
01:20:43 Being with the brothers and sisters,
01:20:44 serving in different forms of assignments,
01:20:48 I can definitely say without one shadow of a doubt
01:20:50 that I still would not swap it for the world.
01:21:01 Well, we’ve enjoyed
01:21:03 a rich spiritual feast so far.
01:21:06 But there’s more to come.
01:21:10 What a blessing these graduates will be
01:21:13 to the brothers and sisters in their assignments!
01:21:16 The second and third parts of the graduation
01:21:19 will be available on jw.org later this month.
01:21:24 We know you’re excited to see the rest of the program.
01:21:29 To conclude this month’s broadcast,
01:21:31 let’s go to Tahiti.
01:21:35 It’s the main island of French Polynesia,
01:21:38 a territory of about 118 inhabited islands.
01:21:42 It’s a beautiful land marked by mountains,
01:21:45 waterfalls, and white sand atolls.
01:21:50 The surroundings teem with life.
01:21:52 Manta rays glide through the water
01:21:55 while the land produces
01:21:57 an abundance of beautiful flower species.
01:21:59 The beauty of this island
01:22:01 is found not only in its natural scenery
01:22:04 but also in the hospitable attitude of the people.
01:22:08 Our brothers and sisters of the Vaima Congregation make it a priority
01:22:13 to share the beauty of God’s Word.
01:22:16 Their territory extends from the city center
01:22:19 to the mountains and remote islands
01:22:21 of Apataki and Rikitea.
01:22:25 They witness to the local fishermen at the beach
01:22:28 and to the international sailors at its large harbors,
01:22:31 and their efforts have proven successful.
01:22:34 Currently, the congregation is conducting 107 Bible studies.
01:22:40 And yes, 107 brothers and sisters
01:22:43 from the Vaima Congregation
01:22:45 send their warm greetings to you
01:22:47 wherever you are globally!
01:22:50 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:22:53 this is JW Broadcasting!
