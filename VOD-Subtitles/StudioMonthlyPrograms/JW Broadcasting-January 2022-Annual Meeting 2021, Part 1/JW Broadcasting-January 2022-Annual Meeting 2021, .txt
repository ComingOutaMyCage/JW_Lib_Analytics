00:00:01 Welcome to the January 2022 edition
00:00:05 of JW Broadcasting®!
00:00:26 The 137th annual meeting
00:00:29 of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
00:00:31 of Pennsylvania
00:00:33 was held on October 2, 2021.
00:00:36 How joyful it was to be together in person
00:00:41 in the Warwick auditorium for this event!
00:00:44 The Bethel family members in attendance
00:00:47 enjoyed a wonderful lineup of spiritual talks,
00:00:51 exciting updates, and videos.
00:00:54 Now we’re delighted to be able to share
00:00:57 the entire program with you here on JW Broadcasting.
00:01:02 The Governing Body assigned me to be the chairman for the annual meeting
00:01:06 and to anchor the January and February JW Broadcasts.
00:01:10 This month, we’ll see the first part of the program,
00:01:14 and Part 2 will be featured in next month’s broadcast.
00:01:18 So please enjoy the first half
00:01:22 of the 2021 annual meeting.
00:01:26 Do you know what time it is?
00:01:30 Most of us are conscious of time every day.
00:01:34 We have a time to go to work, a time to go to school, a time to eat,
00:01:38 a time for our Christian meetings,
00:01:41 and even a time for association
00:01:44 with our dear friends.
00:01:46 As the Great Timekeeper,
00:01:49 Jehovah reminds us at Ecclesiastes 3:1
00:01:53 that there is a proper “time for everything.”
00:01:57 And thus, it’s not surprising that the Bible speaks
00:02:00 of the right time for various events.
00:02:04 For example, at Leviticus 26:4,
00:02:08 Jehovah promised the obedient Israelites
00:02:11 that he would bless them with “showers of rain at [the] proper time.”
00:02:16 Well, that’s just a detail, probably, for most of us.
00:02:20 But if you’ve ever lived in a farming community
00:02:22 or you’ve done farming yourself,
00:02:24 you know that rain at the right time
00:02:28 can give you a bumper crop,
00:02:31 but rain at the wrong time
00:02:33 can completely destroy that same crop.
00:02:37 Even words can be spoken at the right time.
00:02:41 Proverbs 15:23 says:
00:02:44 “A word spoken at the right time
00:02:46 —how good it is!”
00:02:49 Truly, it is a fundamental principle
00:02:53 that timing is everything.
00:02:56 Well, think for a moment about prophesied events
00:03:00 that took place right on time.
00:03:03 Jesus was baptized at precisely the time
00:03:07 when the Messiah was prophesied to appear.
00:03:10 The Kingdom began its heavenly rule
00:03:13 right on time in 1914.
00:03:17 And looking to the future, Jesus said
00:03:20 that Jehovah has set the time,
00:03:22 even the exact day and the hour,
00:03:26 for the end of this wicked system of things.
00:03:31 Does the Governing Body know
00:03:34 when Armageddon is going to come?
00:03:38 Yes, we do.
00:03:40 It’s going to come right on time.
00:03:45 We have full confidence in that —don’t we?—
00:03:48 that Jehovah is going to bring about those earth-shaking events
00:03:52 exactly on time.
00:03:55 But there is something else that Jehovah has promised
00:03:59 to provide at the proper time.
00:04:01 Would you go to your Bibles?
00:04:02 Let’s look at Matthew chapter 24
00:04:07 and verse 45.
00:04:13 Now, here Jesus posed this question:
00:04:16 “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave
00:04:20 “whom his master appointed over his domestics,
00:04:23 “to give them their food
00:04:26 “at the proper time?
00:04:30 “Happy is that slave if his master
00:04:32 “on coming finds him doing so!
00:04:35 “Truly I say to you, he will appoint him
00:04:38 over all his belongings.”
00:04:41 Well, what did Jesus say here?
00:04:43 He said that he would appoint a “faithful and discreet slave”
00:04:48 who would provide the spiritual food.
00:04:50 But there is another important detail there —did you notice it?
00:04:54 He added “at the proper time.”
00:04:59 Well, because of Jehovah’s perfect sense of time,
00:05:04 he knows exactly what his people need
00:05:08 and he knows exactly the right time to provide it.
00:05:13 Now, just consider  a couple of examples of this.
00:05:17 Just as World War II was erupting,
00:05:21 the November 1, 1939, issue of The Watchtower
00:05:25 featured an in-depth discussion
00:05:27 of the topic of neutrality.
00:05:30 That timing was absolutely perfect.
00:05:35 Because of those articles,
00:05:37 our brothers worldwide
00:05:40 knew exactly what to do
00:05:43 as the war engulfed the entire planet.
00:05:48 Well, after the war as the organization was rapidly growing,
00:05:53 Jehovah’s organization arranged
00:05:55 large international conventions
00:05:59 that were held in New York City.
00:06:01 In 1958, a quarter of a million people —can you imagine?—
00:06:06 overflowed Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds.
00:06:09 Were any of you there?
00:06:12 Well, it’s so wonderful that we still have a few people who were there.
00:06:19 It’s not that I wasn’t in the truth at that time;
00:06:21 it’s just that I wasn’t in the world at that time.
00:06:26 Well, that amazing convention
00:06:29 came just on time.
00:06:32 It energized God’s people and, we could say,
00:06:36 it put Jehovah’s Witnesses on the map.
00:06:41 It was hard to ignore a convention
00:06:44 of a quarter of a million people.
00:06:47 Well, fast forward to 2020
00:06:51 at a time when the world was engulfed
00:06:54 in a global pandemic.
00:06:57 Large gatherings were prohibited in most countries.
00:07:00 Could we go to Yankee Stadium and have
00:07:03 250,000 people there?
00:07:06 No.
00:07:07 But right on time,
00:07:09 Jehovah guided “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:07:13 so that our worldwide brotherhood
00:07:15 could enjoy the convention program from home
00:07:19 —truly, spiritual “food
00:07:22 at the proper time.”
00:07:25 And during the pandemic, we’ve had to change our methods, haven’t we?
00:07:29 We’ve had to receive direction about how to carry out our preaching work
00:07:34 and how to carry out our congregation meetings.
00:07:37 But throughout this period, we have received
00:07:39 powerful, powerful evidence
00:07:43 that Jehovah has given this direction to us at the proper time.
00:07:48 Now, let me just give you a couple of examples.
00:07:50 During the 2021 service year,
00:07:57 at least 22 branches
00:08:00 have reported an all-time peak in the number of publishers.
00:08:05 Can you imagine—during the pandemic?
00:08:08 For example, the Korea branch
00:08:12 has reported a new peak in publishers
00:08:15 every month during the 2021 service year.
00:08:20 Isn’t that amazing—during a pandemic?
00:08:31 And with so many wonderful things happening in the field,
00:08:34 I’m sure that you’re all wondering
00:08:36 about our worldwide Memorial attendance
00:08:40 for 2021.
00:08:43 Well, by the undeserved kindness
00:08:46 of our amazing God, Jehovah,
00:08:49 we have reached an all-time peak,
00:08:52 crossing the 21 million mark.
00:08:57 Would you like to know the exact figure?
00:09:05 Well, “keep on the watch”!
00:09:07 It’ll be announced today at the proper time.
00:09:13 Well, today in our program,
00:09:15 we are going to have a wonderful buffet
00:09:18 of rich spiritual food of many varieties and types.
00:09:23 And by the end of the program, I’m sure that you’ll agree
00:09:27 that it was just what we needed
00:09:30 at this moment in time.
00:09:34 Well, last year at the 2020 annual meeting,
00:09:37 the Governing Body was excited to release
00:09:39 a new publication to study with interested ones entitled
00:09:44 Enjoy Life Forever! —An Interactive Bible Course.
00:09:49 It introduced a new and innovative way
00:09:52 to study the Bible with interested ones.
00:09:55 How has the publication been received by Jehovah’s people?
00:09:58 And maybe more to the point,
00:10:00 How is this new format touching the hearts
00:10:03 of those studying the Bible with us?
00:10:06 Please enjoy this video.
00:10:18 How thrilled we were
00:10:19 at last year’s annual meeting
00:10:21 to receive a new publication:
00:10:24 Enjoy Life Forever! —An Interactive Bible Course !
00:10:28 Already many publishers are having success
00:10:31 in conducting progressive studies using this new tool.
00:10:36 As you listen to experiences from around the world,
00:10:39 note the evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.
00:10:44 When they made the announcement
00:10:45 of the new publication,
00:10:47 for me it was just pure excitement.
00:10:49 Actually, I was so overjoyed
00:10:51 that I kept going to the website
00:10:53 around the time of the release,
00:10:55 and at times I would even refresh my browser
00:10:57 a few times a day to see when it was out.
00:11:00 Having all the teaching methods
00:11:02 right in our hands
00:11:03 —what more can we ask for?
00:11:05 We were so excited that during this pandemic,
00:11:08 Jehovah has given us something
00:11:10 to energize our ministry.
00:11:13 When you heard that we would be using a new method for conducting studies,
00:11:18 were you a bit hesitant?
00:11:21 Pay close attention to what experienced teachers are saying
00:11:24 about the benefits of this approach.
00:11:28 Before, it wasn’t uncommon
00:11:30 to hear students start their comments
00:11:32 with expressions like “the paragraph says”
00:11:34 or “as the book mentions.”
00:11:36 Now it’s not like that.
00:11:37 In the old way of teaching,
00:11:39 it was a bit difficult for me to discern
00:11:41 if my Bible students really understood
00:11:44 what they were learning or if the truth reached their hearts.
00:11:48 I think I was using
00:11:49 too many additional points
00:11:51 to convey one idea
00:11:52 and just explaining too much,
00:11:54 so my Bible students would get even more confused.
00:11:59 With some well-educated people,
00:12:01 the studies were in a sense
00:12:03 too easy for them.
00:12:05 They found the answer very easily from the paragraph
00:12:08 and were able to answer correctly,
00:12:11 but it was very hard to know what they really thought about the matter.
00:12:15 With this new book,
00:12:17 it seems like it is easier to see
00:12:19 the person’s genuine thoughts on the matter.
00:12:23 In the previous method,
00:12:25 you would see the student
00:12:27 looking at the book a lot,
00:12:30 but that doesn’t happen now.
00:12:32 When you look at the student,
00:12:34 you can tell he is thinking about the answer
00:12:38 instead of looking for the answer.
00:12:41 They used to enjoy the Bible study in the past,
00:12:44 but now they enjoy it much more.
00:12:48 Now they are able to keep focused
00:12:50 from the beginning to the end of our session.
00:12:54 They feel motivated and closer to Jehovah.
00:13:00 To reach the heart of a Bible student,
00:13:02 we need to understand what he’s thinking and feeling.
00:13:06 How does the Enjoy Life Forever!  book help us to do that?
00:13:11 One of the things I love about it
00:13:13 is how after we read the Bible verse,
00:13:15 there are the questions that follow it
00:13:17 that are perfectly phrased for us.
00:13:19 It really engages our students’ hearts,
00:13:22 and it helps them to understand
00:13:24 the Bible teachings right away,
00:13:26 and it helps us to see what’s in their heart as well.
00:13:28 It lets the student express
00:13:30 what is in his heart,
00:13:32 which allows us to help him.
00:13:35 The first time I looked
00:13:37 through this publication,
00:13:38 I could already see
00:13:39 how appealing its format is.
00:13:41 There are no lengthy paragraphs,
00:13:43 and it is prepared in a very interactive way.
00:13:48 With this new method, I definitely talk less.
00:13:51 My students talk more.
00:13:53 And the one that starts it all off
00:13:55 —the introduction video—
00:13:57 just makes everything fit together.
00:13:59 And one of the amazing things
00:14:01 that it introduces right away is the prayer,
00:14:05 because often as a teacher, we didn’t know exactly
00:14:08 when to introduce prayer or how to do it,
00:14:10 but the video does it for us.
00:14:26 Obviously, teachers are excited about the new book.
00:14:30 But what impact is it having on their students?
00:14:35 Bible students
00:14:36 have been pleasantly surprised.
00:14:38 I asked one student how he felt
00:14:41 to be using this new publication.
00:14:43 And the response was:
00:14:45 “Why didn’t we do this sooner?
00:14:48 It’s great! I’m a lot calmer.”
00:14:51 Another student told me that she was relieved
00:14:53 to no longer have to find the answers
00:14:55 but, rather, to express her thoughts and feelings.
00:14:59 During our discussion
00:15:00 of the “Dig Deeper” section in lesson 02,
00:15:02 my Bible student really appreciated
00:15:05 the scriptures and the beautiful artwork.
00:15:09 He said that he could already see himself in Paradise
00:15:12 enjoying the many promises of Jehovah.
00:15:14 He said that our discussion
00:15:17 made him feel Jehovah’s love.
00:15:20 With the students,
00:15:21 they’re not so overwhelmed with the new book
00:15:23 when we ask them to prepare the lesson.
00:15:26 With the Bible Teach  book, when we would ask them
00:15:28 to prepare these paragraphs,
00:15:30 it was like you asked them to go to the dentist.
00:15:32 They just seemed so intimidated by it.
00:15:34 But now they smile, and they’re like, “OK, I can do that.”
00:15:38 One student in particular
00:15:40 wrote in the “Goal” box:
00:15:42 “I want to share the points
00:15:44 “from this lesson
00:15:46 with my friends and work colleagues within a week.”
00:15:48 And he did.
00:15:50 One of the videos that was really effective
00:15:53 was the one from lesson 04,
00:15:55 My Search for the True God.
00:15:57 It shows the experience of Sister Soten Yoeun.
00:16:00 My students were deeply moved.
00:16:03 They really felt Jehovah’s love for them
00:16:06 and wanted to speak with him.
00:16:08 They felt motivated to pray.
00:16:11 We were studying the first lesson with an 83-year-old lady
00:16:15 when we came across Matthew 7:7.
00:16:21 She read it in her own Bible,
00:16:23 and at first she didn’t quite understand it.
00:16:29 Then we pondered over the verse together with the question.
00:16:32 And then all of a sudden she asked:
00:16:35 “Oh! Does this verse mean
00:16:37 “that I should dig for the answers in the Bible myself
00:16:40 instead of asking a priest?”
00:16:43 It was quite a special moment.
00:16:47 The video
00:16:48 under “Learn to enjoy Bible reading”
00:16:50 was very helpful for one young man.
00:16:53 After watching it,
00:16:54 he set the goal of reading the Bible every day.
00:16:59 With one Bible student,
00:17:00 we had encouraged him to become an unbaptized publisher
00:17:03 in the previous study book.
00:17:05 And now when we were in lesson 02 of our new study publication,
00:17:10 he expressed the desire to become an unbaptized publisher
00:17:14 because he felt he could share one or two points from each lesson
00:17:18 with his friends and others that he knew.
00:17:21 And so now he is approved, and he’s doing very well in the ministry.
00:17:25 Thanks to this new book, I now conduct 15 Bible studies.
00:17:30 The book helps them to maintain the desire and motivation
00:17:33 to keep learning about Jehovah,
00:17:35 his beautiful qualities, and the future that awaits us.
00:17:40 Clearly, our worldwide brotherhood is excited
00:17:44 to use Enjoy Life Forever!
00:17:47 What a tremendous gift from Jehovah!
00:17:50 Of all the facets of our ministry,
00:17:53 without question
00:17:55 conducting a progressive Bible study
00:17:57 is the most satisfying aspect.
00:18:00 And now we have the tool
00:18:01 and the method to make it much easier.
00:18:03 I’m very grateful for this tool.
00:18:06 It really helps us to sense
00:18:08 how close the Governing Body
00:18:10 recognizes we are to the end,
00:18:13 but it in no way feels like a rushed program.
00:18:16 The heart is definitely being reached gently and lovingly,
00:18:19 but then that is what motivates quickly.
00:18:22 Try and introduce it as much as you can.
00:18:24 Start those Bible studies.
00:18:26 And when you do,
00:18:28 please invite me to join in on your new Bible study.
00:18:42 The new book Enjoy Life Forever!
00:18:44 shows clearly that “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:18:46 has been, is, and will continue to give
00:18:50 exactly what we need at exactly the right time.
00:18:54 This publication has the potential
00:18:57 to help many more honesthearted ones
00:19:00 come to know and love our wonderful Father, Jehovah.
00:19:04 May he bless you and your Bible students
00:19:07 as you put to use this new tool.
00:19:23 Well, that was very, very encouraging,
00:19:26 and we apologize to all those who work in the dental office.
00:19:31 We do appreciate your hard work.
00:19:34 Well, no doubt many of you are experiencing similar blessings
00:19:38 as you are conducting Bible studies in this wonderful new tool.
00:19:41 If you are not presently conducting a Bible study,
00:19:45 why not make it a matter of earnest prayer to Jehovah?
00:19:49 Because there is no experience
00:19:52 quite like having a Bible study in this wonderful new publication.
00:19:57 Well, for the past several years,
00:19:59 a unique feature of our annual meeting program
00:20:02 has been a new so-called epic edition
00:20:06 of the Become Jehovah’s Friend  series.
00:20:09 We call it an epic because it is longer than the usual episodes.
00:20:14 We are now pleased to present
00:20:16 Become Jehovah’s Friend —Does Jehovah Answer Prayers?
00:20:24 Hey, Sophia, we know you’re in there.
00:20:28 Please, Jehovah, make it stop!
00:20:31 Heh, heh, heh.
00:20:33 What a loser!
00:20:34 Loser.
00:20:35 Let’s go.
00:20:36 Yeah, let’s get out of here.
00:21:01 All right, class,
00:21:02 today we’re going to discuss—
00:21:05 Sophia? You’re late.
00:21:08 I’m sorry. Uh, I was—
00:21:11 Never mind.
00:21:12 We’ll talk about this later.
00:21:14 Oooooooooo.
00:21:16 OK, OK. That’s enough.
00:21:18 Sophia, take your seat.
00:21:21 Today, we’re going to discuss the difference
00:21:23 between division and long division.
00:21:32 OK, class.
00:21:33 Here are the results from yesterday’s test.
00:21:35 Good work, Sophia.
00:21:42 Hey, Angela.
00:21:44 What did you get?
00:21:45 I don’t care.
00:21:48 Whoa!
00:21:48 D plus?
00:21:50 Well, at least there’s a plus.
00:21:53 Whatever.
00:21:56 What are you looking at?
00:22:00 Uh, hehe.
00:22:15 Sophia.
00:22:31 Uhhh!
00:22:33 Uhhh!
00:22:37 Oops! I didn’t see you there.
00:22:40 It’s like you’re invisible.
00:22:47 Oh, what’s this?
00:22:52 No!
00:22:55 See you tomorrow.
00:22:58 Loser.
00:23:12 Are you OK?
00:23:15 Let me help.
00:23:18 Sometimes they pick on me too.
00:23:31 It was amazing!
00:23:33 And then Ms. Wilson said I could hold the bunny,
00:23:35 but I had to be very gentle.
00:23:38 Really?
00:23:40 I named him Fred.
00:23:42 But I didn’t get to hold him for very long.
00:23:45 I’m pretty much a bunny expert now.
00:23:51 Oh! Is everything all right, Honey?
00:23:54 Um . . .
00:23:57 See you tomorrow.
00:24:01 I’m fine.
00:24:11 OK.
00:24:12 Let’s talk about something very important:
00:24:15 prayer.
00:24:17 Caleb,
00:24:18 what are some things that you can pray for?
00:24:22 Well, I can pray for things
00:24:24 that make me happy
00:24:28 like a helicopter
00:24:32 or a mountain of ice cream
00:24:39 —uh, without the bellyache—
00:24:45 and Fred!
00:24:47 I see.
00:24:49 But tell me: When we pray before bedtime,
00:24:52 what do we pray for?
00:24:55 We thank Jehovah for the good things he made
00:24:58 like, like, animals,
00:25:01 the stars, and the ocean
00:25:05 and God’s Kingdom
00:25:07 and to help our brothers and sisters!
00:25:10 That’s right!
00:25:11 You can pray for your brothers and sisters.
00:25:14 And remember,
00:25:15 they are praying for you too.
00:25:17 We know that when we pray for the right things,
00:25:20 Jehovah hears us!
00:25:22 Then why doesn’t he answer my  prayers?
00:25:25 Oh! What’s wrong, Sophia?
00:25:28 You can tell us.
00:25:31 There’s a girl at school.
00:25:34 She’s so mean to me.
00:25:37 Oh, no!
00:25:41 Oh, Honey, it’s OK.
00:25:44 I prayed for it to stop,
00:25:47 but nothing’s happened.
00:25:50 Is Jehovah mad at me?
00:25:52 No, my dear.
00:25:54 Jehovah isn’t mad at you.
00:25:57 Maybe Jehovah can’t see me!
00:26:01 No!
00:26:06 There is someone in the Bible
00:26:08 who felt the same way you do.
00:26:11 Her name was Hannah.
00:26:18 Hannah loved Jehovah very much.
00:26:22 Hey, wait for me!
00:26:25 But someone named Peninnah
00:26:28 was very mean to her.
00:26:30 It’s so nice to see the children play,
00:26:33 isn’t it?
00:26:36 She had a bully too?
00:26:38 Yes.
00:26:43 We’re ready to eat.
00:26:45 Here’s your portion, Hannah.
00:26:48 And Peninnah, here’s yours.
00:26:51 She was very jealous of Hannah.
00:26:57 Ah, I’ll get some water.
00:27:02 You think you’re so special, Hannah?
00:27:08 Then why hasn’t Jehovah given you
00:27:10 any children?
00:27:17 Are you OK, Hannah?
00:27:19 Why are you so sad?
00:27:21 Others could not understand
00:27:23 why Hannah was so upset
00:27:25 because the pain was in her heart.
00:27:30 So she talked to the One
00:27:32 who would  understand.
00:27:48 O Jehovah, please, see me.
00:27:52 Remember me.
00:27:54 And do not forget me.
00:27:57 Please give me a child.
00:28:01 If you do,
00:28:03 I will give him to you all his life
00:28:06 to serve you.
00:28:14 What are you doing?
00:28:17 Why are you drunk?
00:28:21 I’m not drunk.
00:28:22 I’m under great stress.
00:28:26 Oh.
00:28:28 I’ve been praying for Jehovah to help me.
00:28:33 Go in peace,
00:28:35 and may Jehovah give you
00:28:36 what you’ve asked for.
00:28:42 Do you know why Hannah felt better
00:28:44 even though her prayer wasn’t answered yet?
00:28:48 Why?
00:28:50 Because Hannah knew Jehovah heard her prayer.
00:28:54 When Jehovah listens to your prayers,
00:28:57 he really listens.
00:29:00 And he knows just what we need
00:29:02 even better than we do.
00:29:05 But how does he answer them?
00:29:08 In lots of different ways.
00:29:10 Sometimes, we just have to wait and see.
00:29:13 Because he’s busy?
00:29:15 No.
00:29:16 Because it can be hard for us
00:29:18 to see the answer.
00:29:20 Let’s talk about what you can pray for . . .
00:29:24 . . . and what you can do tomorrow at school
00:29:26 to work along with those prayers.
00:29:33 I know that Angela and the other girls
00:29:35 are going to be mean to me.
00:29:38 But please help me
00:29:40 to be like Hannah tomorrow.
00:29:44 Help me to be strong like her.
00:29:53 And then she went to the tabernacle,
00:29:55 and Eli was there.
00:29:57 He was the high priest.
00:30:18 Oh, no!
00:30:19 It’s them! Run!
00:30:23 Look who it is.
00:30:25 Look over there. It’s them!
00:30:27 What do you think she did?
00:30:28 What did she say?
00:30:32 Is there about to be a fight?
00:30:35 Angela would win.
00:30:36 What do you want, Angela?
00:30:38 Oh, I was just wondering
00:30:40 if you had a pen that I can borrow.
00:30:49 Agh!
00:30:50 What do I do?
00:30:53 Jehovah heard her prayer.
00:30:58 Jehovah, it’s me, Caleb.
00:31:01 Please help Sophia.
00:31:06 And please
00:31:08 help Sophia be strong at school today.
00:31:10 Watch over the children in our congregation
00:31:13 like Caleb and Sophia.
00:31:15 Please watch over our children.
00:31:17 Help our children make you proud, Jehovah.
00:31:20 Please, Jehovah, give our children
00:31:22 the strength they need to face pressures.
00:31:23 Jehovah, please!
00:31:26 I need your help!
00:31:30 We ask you this prayer in Jesus’ name.
00:31:33 Amen!
00:31:38 Amen.
00:31:40 What? Are you gonna cry?
00:31:43 Stop, Angela.
00:31:45 You’re being mean.
00:31:47 And if you keep being mean,
00:31:48 I’m going to tell.
00:31:51 No, you won’t.
00:31:52 Yes, I will.
00:31:53 You can’t tell me what to do.
00:31:56 Let’s go, Zoe.
00:32:05 That’s my sister!
00:32:09 You’re so brave.
00:32:11 How did you do that?
00:32:12 I prayed for courage, and Jehovah helped me.
00:32:25 Hannah gave birth to a son
00:32:27 and named him Samuel
00:32:29 because as she said, . . .
00:32:32 It is from Jehovah that I have asked him.
00:32:38 There is no one holy like Jehovah.
00:32:41 There is no one but you.
00:32:50 Thank you, Jehovah.
00:32:59 Well, that was
00:33:01 truly spiritual “food at the proper time.”
00:33:05 And while it will touch the hearts of all of our young ones,
00:33:09 I think that message is something
00:33:11 we all need to hear and take to heart at this time.
00:33:15 Well, now we have the privilege
00:33:17 to hear three Scriptural talks by members of the Governing Body.
00:33:21 We’ll first enjoy a talk by our dear Brother David Splane entitled
00:33:26 “The Way of Holiness.”
00:33:32 Incredible!
00:33:36 That’s the only way to describe it.
00:33:40 The word had gone out that the Jews
00:33:43 who had been captives in Babylon were free to leave
00:33:47 and to return to their homeland, Israel.
00:33:51 Now, you all know why that was incredible:
00:33:55 because Babylon never released its captives.
00:33:59 But Babylon had been overthrown,
00:34:02 and the new administration had said
00:34:05 that the Jews were free to go.
00:34:08 Only Jehovah could have been responsible for that.
00:34:14 So every family head had a decision to make:
00:34:19 to leave Babylon or to stay behind.
00:34:24 Now, you might say:
00:34:27 “There was no decision to make at all.
00:34:29 That’s not a hard decision.”
00:34:31 But wait. Hold it.
00:34:34 Most of the Jews had been born in Babylon.
00:34:39 And most of their parents
00:34:41 had been born in Babylon.
00:34:45 It was the only home they knew.
00:34:48 Their roots were there.
00:34:51 And according to certain records, some of them had gotten prosperous.
00:34:56 Some of them had gotten wealthy.
00:34:58 There are records of Jews buying and selling precious gems
00:35:02 and other luxury items.
00:35:05 So one says: “I can’t leave Babylon.
00:35:10 “My business partner is a Babylonian,
00:35:13 “and the business is doing really well,
00:35:15 and there would be no market for the products we sell in Israel.”
00:35:19 Another would say:
00:35:21 “My son married a Babylonian woman,
00:35:24 “and they just had a baby,
00:35:26 “our first grandchild.
00:35:28 “He’s so cute.
00:35:29 I can’t leave now.”
00:35:31 So on the one hand, you have these material benefits
00:35:35 from remaining in Babylon.
00:35:38 But on the other hand,
00:35:40 the ability of the Jews to worship Jehovah freely
00:35:44 was severely limited.
00:35:46 It’s said that there were 50 pagan temples
00:35:50 in the capital alone.
00:35:52 But there was no temple of Jehovah there.
00:35:55 And the Levites weren’t able to follow the Law of Moses properly.
00:36:00 They could only do so to a limited degree.
00:36:03 So you had material advantages to staying,
00:36:06 but the spiritual blessings that awaited those who chose to leave
00:36:11 were going to be immense.
00:36:14 And for spiritually-minded Jews,
00:36:16 it was no contest
00:36:18 because they wanted to leave Babylon
00:36:21 and reestablish pure worship
00:36:24 in the Promised Land in Israel.
00:36:27 And so if they were physically able to do so,
00:36:31 they would leave Babylon
00:36:34 and travel to Jerusalem,
00:36:36 a city most of them had never seen,
00:36:40 a city in ruins.
00:36:44 But Jehovah promised to make the trip from Babylon to Jerusalem
00:36:49 as easy as possible.
00:36:51 And to confirm that and to get a little picture in our minds,
00:36:54 we’re going to read a series of four different scriptures.
00:36:59 And each scripture is going to add a little detail to what Jehovah had in mind.
00:37:03 So the first one is found at Isaiah chapter 40,
00:37:08 verses 3 and 4.
00:37:10 And I’ll wait a moment because it’d be good if we could read this together.
00:37:15 This is Isaiah chapter 40,
00:37:17 the well-known words of verses 3, 4:
00:37:23 “A voice of one calling out in the wilderness:
00:37:27 “‘Clear up the way of Jehovah!
00:37:30 “‘Make a straight highway through the desert
00:37:35 “‘[a straight highway through the desert] for our God.
00:37:39 “‘Let every valley be raised up,
00:37:42 “‘and every mountain and hill be made low.
00:37:45 “‘The rough ground must become level,
00:37:48 and the rugged ground, a valley plain.’”
00:37:52 You know, every time I read these words, I think of Brother Carey Barber.
00:37:56 He must have loved this passage because very often in his prayers
00:38:01 he would quote this passage word for word
00:38:04 —good memories of Brother Barber.
00:38:06 But now, it talks about making “a straight highway through the desert.”
00:38:12 If some of you have gone to the Ramapo project,
00:38:16 you know what site work is all about.
00:38:20 How would you like to have the Construction Committee in Ramapo
00:38:24 take that job on?
00:38:26 “Make a straight highway through the desert.
00:38:29 “When you come to a mountain, you’ve got to level it.
00:38:31 When you come to a valley, you’ve got to bring it up.”
00:38:33 That would be quite a job.
00:38:35 I think they have enough on their plate.
00:38:37 They don’t need to worry about this kind of site work.
00:38:39 But this was going to be a big job.
00:38:41 But in the end, it would be a lot easier to travel on a straight highway
00:38:46 than to go up and down a mountain or down a valley.
00:38:50 And it would be a lot faster too.
00:38:53 So we know that there was going to be a straight highway
00:38:57 between Babylon and Jerusalem.
00:39:00 What else can we learn?
00:39:01 Isaiah 57,
00:39:04 Isaiah 57:14
00:39:13 —verse 14 says: “It will be said:
00:39:15 “‘Build up, build up a road!
00:39:18 “‘Prepare the way!
00:39:19 “‘[and here it comes] Remove any obstacle
00:39:23 from the way of my people.’”
00:39:26 So now we have two details:
00:39:28 It’s  going to be a straight highway through the desert,
00:39:31 and all of the obstacles are going to be cleared away.
00:39:36 But now, most highways have a name.
00:39:39 Some of them are named after famous people;
00:39:41 others have a number.
00:39:43 Does this special highway have a name?
00:39:46 It does.
00:39:47 And we go to Isaiah 35:8, 9 to find that name.
00:39:55 I’m giving you a real workout this morning,
00:39:57 but we have to do this to put it all together.
00:40:00 Isaiah 35:8, 9:
00:40:05 “And a highway will be there, yes,
00:40:07 “a way called [here it comes]
00:40:10 “the Way of Holiness.
00:40:13 “The unclean one will not travel on it.
00:40:16 “It is reserved for the one walking on the way;
00:40:19 “no one foolish will stray onto it.
00:40:23 “No lion will be there,
00:40:25 “and no vicious wild beasts will come on it.
00:40:30 “They will not be found there.
00:40:32 Only the repurchased ones will walk there.”
00:40:35 So, what’s the name?
00:40:37 What’s the special name of this highway?
00:40:40 “The Way of Holiness.”
00:40:42 Isn’t that a nice name for a highway?
00:40:44 Rattlesnakes, bears,
00:40:48 foxes, and cougars are not allowed.
00:40:53 I don’t care how cute you think they are.
00:40:55 They’re not allowed on this special highway.
00:40:59 Now,
00:41:01 what else can we learn about this special highway?
00:41:04 Today, you don’t know who is traveling in the car next to yours.
00:41:09 It could be somebody who has no business driving a car.
00:41:13 The driver could be drunk.
00:41:15 He could be on drugs.
00:41:17 But on this highway, the unclean one is not permitted.
00:41:22 Those who would break God’s laws are not permitted to travel on that highway.
00:41:27 Well, we’re talking about the highway between Babylon and Jerusalem.
00:41:32 And no doubt unclean ones among the Jews
00:41:35 wouldn’t be interested in going back to Israel anyway.
00:41:37 They were probably very much at home
00:41:40 with the idolatry of Babylon.
00:41:42 Remember, their forefathers were no strangers to idolatry.
00:41:47 So only those who were clean and acceptable in Jehovah’s eyes
00:41:50 were welcome to travel from Babylon back to Jerusalem.
00:41:55 Now, let’s be clear.
00:41:57 We don’t know whether there was any literal roadwork
00:42:01 done on the road between Babylon and Israel.
00:42:05 It may be all figurative, but there could have been some roadwork done.
00:42:09 Notice what Jehovah told the Jews to do
00:42:12 in Jeremiah 31:21.
00:42:19 And you would ask, ‘Why would Jehovah
00:42:21 say all of these things if it was all to be ignored literally?’
00:42:25 At Jeremiah 31:21,
00:42:29 he says: “Set up road markers for yourself,
00:42:34 “and put up signposts.
00:42:36 “Pay attention to the highway, the way that you have to go.
00:42:40 “Return, O virgin of Israel,
00:42:42 return to these cities of yours.”
00:42:46 So no doubt the first groups to use the road
00:42:50 would remove obstacles and level things out the best they could
00:42:55 so that those who followed would have an easier journey.
00:42:59 So, now, what have we learned?
00:43:01 What have we gleaned from this series of scriptures?
00:43:04 First, there was a highway, a highway through the desert.
00:43:08 We’ve also learned that it was to be cleared of obstacles.
00:43:12 It has a special name,
00:43:14 “the Way of Holiness.”
00:43:16 And there were to be signposts so that those who traveled the road
00:43:21 wouldn’t get lost and maybe stray onto some other road.
00:43:25 Now, what was the goal?
00:43:27 Why did Jehovah want this road to be prepared so nicely?
00:43:31 To make it as easy as possible
00:43:34 for the Jews to leave Babylon
00:43:38 and go back to Israel and reestablish pure worship.
00:43:44 Did it work?
00:43:46 Tens of thousands of men, women,
00:43:49 and children responded to the call (the invitation)
00:43:54 and with Jehovah’s help, they arrived safely at their destination.
00:43:59 Well, you might be thinking: ‘This is all very nice.
00:44:02 ‘But what does it have to do with me?
00:44:05 What does it have to do with us today?’
00:44:08 Plenty.
00:44:10 Because today, not tens of thousands
00:44:13 but millions of men, women, and children
00:44:16 are responding to the command,
00:44:19 the urgent command to “get out of her,”
00:44:22 get out of “Babylon the Great.”
00:44:25 And the situation is different from the situation
00:44:27 of the Jews in ancient times because they had a choice.
00:44:31 They could remain in Babylon and still serve Jehovah.
00:44:35 But people today have no choice.
00:44:38 They must leave Babylon the Great.
00:44:41 Their life depends on it.
00:44:45 Now, without looking for a type and antitype,
00:44:48 trying to fit everything in very neatly in this arrangement,
00:44:53 we can say that there are some similarities
00:44:56 between what happened to the Jews in ancient times
00:44:58 and what is happening today,
00:45:01 because in a sense, when you start to study the Bible with someone,
00:45:05 you are pointing him in the direction of “the Way of Holiness.”
00:45:10 Now, some start studying,
00:45:12 and they start traveling on the road, and then they turn back.
00:45:15 But others keep going,
00:45:17 and they become dedicated, baptized disciples of Christ.
00:45:22 Some travel in the fast lane.
00:45:25 They make rapid progress.
00:45:27 Others sort of take the far right lane,
00:45:30 and they poke along, but they keep making progress.
00:45:33 And as long as they keep making progress, we’ll study with them.
00:45:38 Some break down, and that calls for roadside assistance.
00:45:44 But it’s easier to travel on “the Way of Holiness” today
00:45:48 than it ever has been.
00:45:51 And, friends,
00:45:52 this is partly due to the spiritual site work
00:45:57 that was started centuries ago.
00:46:01 I’m going to repeat that.
00:46:03 It is easier to travel ‘the highway of holiness’ today
00:46:07 because of the spiritual site work
00:46:09 that was started hundreds of years ago,
00:46:13 long before Babylon the Great fell,
00:46:17 long before the road was opened for travelers.
00:46:21 Now, picture this: It’s the 16th century.
00:46:26 With shovel in hand,
00:46:28 you are about to start site work on “the Way of Holiness.”
00:46:33 There is a mountain ahead of you
00:46:35 —a mountain of ignorance.
00:46:38 And you realize that if you are going to start to level that mountain,
00:46:42 the first thing you’re going to have to do is get the Bible
00:46:45 into the hands of the people.
00:46:47 For years, the Bible was just only in Latin,
00:46:49 and only mostly educated people could read it.
00:46:53 And even some of the clergy only knew enough Latin
00:46:56 to conduct church services; but otherwise, they couldn’t understand it.
00:47:01 Well, if you’ve been to our beautiful museum
00:47:05 (some of you have taken a tour recently),
00:47:07 you know that translators in many countries risked their freedom
00:47:12 and even their lives to put the Bible into the language of the common people.
00:47:17 And then printers produced those translations.
00:47:21 And some of them used an assumed name,
00:47:23 because if they got caught printing a Bible,
00:47:26 they could be arrested and even worse.
00:47:30 So the mountain had to be leveled
00:47:33 a shovelful at a time
00:47:35 —one Bible at a time—
00:47:38 to reduce that mountain on “the Way of Holiness.”
00:47:43 To get the Bible into the hands of the people,
00:47:45 William Tyndale
00:47:47 arranged to have thousands of copies
00:47:50 of his translation smuggled into England
00:47:53 in bales of cotton and other goods.
00:47:55 This was dangerous.
00:47:58 Tyndale’s translation was banned in England,
00:48:01 and if you merely possessed a copy of the Bible,
00:48:04 that could bring you a stint in the Tower of London or worse.
00:48:08 But despite desperate attempts to stop work on “the Way of Holiness,”
00:48:12 more copies of Tyndale’s Bible were printed
00:48:16 than the clergy could ever destroy.
00:48:20 By the way, you’d be interested in a comment that Tyndale made
00:48:23 in his comments on the book of Genesis
00:48:26 (the 1530 translation of the book of Genesis).
00:48:29 He wrote: “Jehovah is God’s name.
00:48:32 “Neither is any creature so called.
00:48:35 “As oft as thou seist LORD in capital letters,
00:48:39 it is in Hebrew Jehovah.”
00:48:43 Early on, the name Jehovah was given some recognition.
00:48:48 Well, with the Bible becoming more available to the people,
00:48:52 you’d expect that students of the Bible would want to share
00:48:55 their research with others.
00:48:58 And that was the case.
00:49:00 In the years leading up to 1919 when Babylon the Great fell,
00:49:04 more roadwork was done.
00:49:06 And so we had men who shared the fruitage of their research
00:49:10 in tracts, in books —publications of all kinds—
00:49:13 because they wanted the people to know.
00:49:15 They wanted to reduce that mountain of ignorance.
00:49:19 For example,
00:49:20 about 1835,
00:49:22 a Bible student by the name of Henry Grew
00:49:25 wrote a pamphlet
00:49:27 on the immortality of the soul.
00:49:30 And in that pamphlet, Grew explained from the Bible
00:49:33 that immortality is a reward for faithfulness.
00:49:36 We’re not born with it.
00:49:38 Now, he published the tract anonymously
00:49:41 because he knew there would be trouble.
00:49:43 And later on, there was trouble for Henry Grew.
00:49:47 Well, he publishes a tract.
00:49:49 But two years later,
00:49:51 another Bible student, George Storrs,
00:49:54 is riding in a train,
00:49:56 and he looks down and he sees a tract there,
00:50:01 and it’s Henry Grew’s tract
00:50:03 on the immortality of the soul.
00:50:05 He reads it.
00:50:06 And he becomes convinced that man
00:50:08 doesn’t have an immortal soul.
00:50:09 So, what does he do?
00:50:11 He picks up a shovel,
00:50:13 and he starts working on the road,
00:50:15 the road “the Way of Holiness.”
00:50:18 In 1842, he gave a series of lectures
00:50:21 on the intriguing theme “Are the Wicked Immortal?”
00:50:26 And he later published those lectures.
00:50:28 Do you know how many copies were produced?
00:50:31 Two hundred thousand copies
00:50:34 of that series of lectures.
00:50:37 So that was decent roadwork on that “Way of Holiness.”
00:50:41 Well, Storrs knew that he didn’t have the whole truth on every subject.
00:50:45 And in 1847, he made quite an interesting statement;
00:50:48 it would be interesting for us.
00:50:50 He says: “We . . . do well to remember
00:50:52 “that we have just emerged from the dark ages of the church;
00:50:57 “and [notice this] it would not be . . . strange
00:51:00 “if we should find some ‘Babylonish garments’
00:51:04 still worn by us.”
00:51:07 Well, he was right.
00:51:09 Babylon still had influence in those days.
00:51:13 Well, we know that George Storrs had an influence
00:51:16 on Charles Taze Russell.
00:51:19 Now, what do we know about Brother Russell and his associates?
00:51:24 They weren’t the first to discover that the Trinity
00:51:27 and the immortality of the soul are false doctrines,
00:51:30 or even that Christ’s presence would be invisible to the human eye.
00:51:34 They benefited from the careful preparatory work
00:51:38 that other road workers had done in the past.
00:51:42 So translators, printers,
00:51:45 and Bible students were doing spiritual site work.
00:51:50 And we might say that Brother Russell and his associates
00:51:53 put the final touches on that “Way of Holiness.”
00:51:57 Well, Babylon the Great fell in 1919,
00:52:02 and then “the Way of Holiness” was open for travelers.
00:52:06 But Brother Russell died in 1916.
00:52:11 Did he miss it?
00:52:13 Did he miss the inauguration of the road?
00:52:17 I don’t think so.
00:52:19 He didn’t have a bird’s-eye view of the opening of the road;
00:52:23 he had a heaven’s-eye view,
00:52:26 because Brother Russell and his associates
00:52:29 who had finished their earthly course
00:52:31 were able to look down from the heavens.
00:52:33 And can you imagine how excited they were
00:52:36 when they saw the first travelers
00:52:39 set foot on “the Way of Holiness”?
00:52:41 It must have been very exciting for them indeed.
00:52:45 And it wouldn’t be surprising if Brother Russell and his associates
00:52:50 were firmly involved in the maintenance program
00:52:55 of that “Way of Holiness” today,
00:52:58 because every good road needs ongoing maintenance.
00:53:03 “The Way of Holiness” is open,
00:53:05 but maintenance on that “Way of Holiness” goes on.
00:53:08 And what’s the goal?
00:53:10 It’s to make it as easy as possible
00:53:13 for people to identify Babylon the Great
00:53:16 and to leave Babylon the Great —that is the goal.
00:53:20 Well, take the Bible, for example.
00:53:22 There were Bible translations in 1919,
00:53:25 but some of them were
00:53:27 in archaic language that was hard to understand.
00:53:31 And most of them didn’t give the divine name the place of honor that it deserved.
00:53:36 But now we have the New World Translation.
00:53:39 What a blessing that has proved to be!
00:53:41 It’s so clear, and you don’t have to mortgage the house to buy a copy,
00:53:46 which was probably the case in the 16th century.
00:53:49 And since 1919,
00:53:51 there has been an abundance of spiritual food
00:53:54 to make it easier for people to come into the truth.
00:53:57 Now, just think of this:
00:54:00 In 1919, Babylon the Great fell.
00:54:03 But what else happened in 1919?
00:54:06 What provision did Jehovah make for these people?
00:54:09 “The faithful and discreet slave” was appointed in that same year.
00:54:14 And the slave didn’t waste any time
00:54:17 to start producing literature
00:54:19 that was going to make it easier for people to come into the truth.
00:54:23 In 1919, the slave is appointed.
00:54:25 By 1921, you have a brand new publication,
00:54:30 The Harp of God.
00:54:32 And it was especially designed for beginners
00:54:35 and to make it easy for people to study and read and come into the truth.
00:54:39 And that was necessary because in 1921
00:54:42 there was a shortage of teachers, or publishers,
00:54:45 who could conduct Bible studies with people.
00:54:47 So you really needed something simple.
00:54:50 And comparatively speaking, that Harp of God  was simple.
00:54:55 Now, there were very few publishers in those days, just a few thousand.
00:55:00 But they were workers; they did a tremendous job!
00:55:03 Do you realize that before The Harp of God   went out of print,
00:55:07 almost six million copies
00:55:11 in 22 languages had been circulated?
00:55:15 So this is evidence
00:55:18 that maintenance work on “the Way of Holiness”
00:55:20 had begun right after the road opened.
00:55:25 Well, I doubt that very many in this audience
00:55:28 have come into the truth through The Harp of God.
00:55:31 Anybody here?
00:55:32 I don’t think so.
00:55:35 What publication brought you into the truth?
00:55:38 What publication helped you to identify “the Way of Holiness”?
00:55:42 Was it “The Truth Shall Make You Free,”
00:55:46 “Let God Be True,”
00:55:48 The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,
00:55:51 You Can Live Forever,
00:55:54 the Knowledge book, Enjoy Life Forever!,
00:55:58 Teach Us (What Can the Bible Teach Us? ),
00:56:01 or is it our fine, new publication Enjoy Life Forever!?
00:56:06 All of these publications
00:56:08 have been used to help people to break free from Babylon the Great.
00:56:12 And this is proof positive
00:56:14 that maintenance on “the Way of Holiness” is ongoing.
00:56:19 This roadwork continues, and it gets better and better.
00:56:25 Are you studying the Bible with someone with the help of Enjoy Life Forever! ?
00:56:29 If you are, you’re pointing that person to “the Way of Holiness.”
00:56:34 So don’t be afraid to offer studies,
00:56:38 as Brother Sanderson mentioned,
00:56:40 to business associates, relatives, schoolmates—anybody you can think of.
00:56:45 Offer Bible studies, and you’ll be surprised
00:56:47 at who will take you up on it.
00:56:50 And as you do, keep in mind
00:56:52 that while the road has been made easier for travelers,
00:56:55 setting foot on that road takes courage and effort.
00:56:59 So let’s be ready to help those who are willing to respond.
00:57:04 Millions have already taken that road,
00:57:07 and it’s our hope that millions more will do so
00:57:10 before the end of this system of things.
00:57:13 And we wish them all safe travels.
00:57:24 Well, we sincerely thank you, Brother Splane,
00:57:26 for that fascinating discussion about “the Way of Holiness.”
00:57:30 You know, I once had the opportunity to go to an auction house
00:57:34 and actually hold in my hands
00:57:37 the Tyndale Pentateuch of 1530
00:57:40 of which there are only a very few known copies.
00:57:43 But sadly, I didn’t have $650,000
00:57:48 in my wallet on that day
00:57:50 or a house to mortgage,
00:57:53 so we had to pass.
00:57:55 But in our museum, we do have a facsimile.
00:57:59 And won’t it be a wonderful day when we can reopen our museums
00:58:02 to tours for all of our brothers outside
00:58:04 and they’ll be able to come back and see those wonderful things?
00:58:07 Thank you so much, Brother Splane.
00:58:09 Well, now we have the pleasure to hear from another member of our Governing Body,
00:58:13 Brother Geoffrey Jackson.
00:58:15 He has a very intriguing theme:
00:58:18 “Are You There?”
00:58:22 Are you there?
00:58:24 Is your name there?
00:58:27 Is your name “written in the book of life”?
00:58:31 What “book of life”?
00:58:33 Well, in Malachi chapter 3,
00:58:35 we notice that it refers to “a book of remembrance.”
00:58:40 And this book has a record of all those
00:58:44 ‘who fear Jehovah and treasure his name.’
00:58:48 Yes, this “book of remembrance” is a record of all those
00:58:52 who are in line to receive everlasting life.
00:58:56 So all of us want to have our names written in that book, don’t we?
00:59:02 But if we do have our name in that book,
00:59:06 does that mean that we automatically will receive everlasting life?
00:59:11 No.
00:59:13 We remember what Jehovah said to Moses,
00:59:15 as recorded in Exodus chapter 32.
00:59:18 There he said: ‘Anyone who sins against me,
00:59:21 I will wipe out from my book.’
00:59:25 So names can be erased
00:59:28 from this book of life.
00:59:30 It’s as if our names are written in this book of life
00:59:34 in pencil.
00:59:36 So all of us surely want to make sure
00:59:39 that our names remain in this book of life
00:59:42 right through to the time that they are written permanently in the book
00:59:46 in pen, as it were.
00:59:49 But whose names are in this book of life?
00:59:54 We’re going to consider together five different groups of persons,
00:59:59 some of whom have their names in the book of life and others who don’t.
01:00:04 So let’s watch this presentation that discusses these five groups.
01:00:18 The first group:
01:00:20 Those who have been selected to rule with Jesus in heaven.
01:00:24 Are their names written in this book of life?
01:00:28 According to Philippians 4:3,
01:00:31 the answer is yes.
01:00:33 But even though they’ve been anointed with holy spirit,
01:00:37 they still need to remain faithful
01:00:40 in order to have their names written permanently in this book.
01:00:44 The second group:
01:00:46 the great crowd of Armageddon survivors.
01:00:50 Are the names of these faithful ones now written in the book of life?
01:00:54 Yes.
01:00:57 What about after they survive Armageddon?
01:00:59 Will their names still be in the book of life?
01:01:02 Yes.
01:01:04 How do we know?
01:01:06 At Matthew 25:46, Jesus says
01:01:10 that these sheeplike ones depart
01:01:12 “into everlasting life.”
01:01:15 But does that mean they are granted everlasting life
01:01:18 at the beginning of the Thousand Year Reign?
01:01:21 No.
01:01:22 Revelation 7:17 tells us
01:01:25 that Jesus “will guide them to springs of waters of life.”
01:01:31 So they don’t immediately receive everlasting life.
01:01:35 However, their names are written in the book of life
01:01:38 in pencil, as it were.
01:01:41 The third group:
01:01:42 the goats who will be destroyed at Armageddon.
01:01:46 Their names are not in the book of life.
01:01:50 2 Thessalonians 1:9 tells us:
01:01:54 “These very ones will undergo the judicial punishment
01:01:58 of everlasting destruction.”
01:02:02 The same could be said of those
01:02:04 who have deliberately sinned against the holy spirit.
01:02:07 They too receive everlasting destruction,
01:02:11 not everlasting life.
01:02:15 So the first three groups are
01:02:17 the anointed,
01:02:19 the great crowd,
01:02:20 and the goats.
01:02:22 Of these three,
01:02:24 only two are found in the book of life.
01:02:27 Now let’s talk about two more groups:
01:02:30 Those who will be resurrected
01:02:32 in the new world.
01:02:35 First, though, let’s read together
01:02:37 Acts 24:15.
01:02:40 There the apostle Paul says:
01:02:42 “I have hope toward God,
01:02:45 “which hope these men also look forward to,
01:02:48 “that there is going to be a resurrection
01:02:50 “of both the righteous
01:02:52 and the unrighteous.”
01:02:56 So the fourth group are the righteous who have died.
01:03:00 These include some of our loved ones.
01:03:03 Are their names written in the book of life?
01:03:06 Yes.
01:03:08 Revelation 17:8 tells us
01:03:11 that this book has been in existence since “the founding of the world.”
01:03:15 Jesus referred to Abel as living “from the founding of the world,”
01:03:20 so we can assume that his name
01:03:22 was the first name written in that book.
01:03:26 Since that time, millions of other righteous ones
01:03:29 have had their names added to this book.
01:03:33 Now, here’s an important question:
01:03:36 When these righteous ones died,
01:03:39 were their names taken out of the book of life?
01:03:42 No.
01:03:44 They’re still living in Jehovah’s memory.
01:03:47 Remember, Jesus said that Jehovah
01:03:49 “is a God, not of the dead, but of the living,
01:03:53 for they are all living to him.”
01:03:56 The righteous will be restored to life here on earth
01:03:59 with their names still written in the book of life.
01:04:03 They did good things before they died.
01:04:06 So that is why they will be part
01:04:08 of the resurrection of the righteous ones.
01:04:13 No doubt some of them will receive privileges,
01:04:16 such as serving “as princes in all the earth.”
01:04:20 Finally, let’s talk about the resurrection of “the unrighteous.”
01:04:25 For the most part, the unrighteous didn’t have an opportunity
01:04:29 to develop a relationship with Jehovah.
01:04:32 They did not live righteous lives.
01:04:35 So that’s why they are called unrighteous.
01:04:39 When these unrighteous ones are resurrected,
01:04:42 are their names written in the book of life?
01:04:45 No.
01:04:47 But their being resurrected gives them an opportunity
01:04:51 to have their names eventually written in the book of life.
01:04:56 These unrighteous ones will need a lot of help.
01:05:00 In their former life, some of them practiced
01:05:03 horrible, vile things.
01:05:06 So they’ll need to learn to live by Jehovah’s standards.
01:05:10 To accomplish this,
01:05:12 God’s Kingdom will sponsor the greatest educational program
01:05:17 in all human history.
01:05:21 Who will teach these unrighteous persons?
01:05:25 Those who have their names written in pencil in the book of life
01:05:28 —the great crowd and the resurrected righteous ones.
01:05:33 How can these unrighteous ones
01:05:36 have their names written in the book of life?
01:05:40 They will need to develop a relationship with Jehovah
01:05:42 and dedicate their lives to him.
01:05:46 But will all the unrighteous accept that opportunity?
01:05:50 No.
01:05:52 Remember, all these unrighteous ones
01:05:55 will be under the careful watch of Jesus
01:05:57 and his fellow judges.
01:06:00 Isaiah 65:20 tells us
01:06:03 that those who refuse to accept this help
01:06:05 will be removed.
01:06:08 No one will be allowed to cause any ruin in the new world.
01:06:12 So any who display a wicked attitude during the thousand years
01:06:17 will be removed.
01:06:19 With all these facts in mind then, let’s now read together
01:06:24 John 5:28, 29.
01:06:28 Jesus said: “Do not be amazed at this,
01:06:32 “for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs
01:06:36 “will hear his voice and come out,
01:06:39 “those who did good things
01:06:42 “to a resurrection of life,
01:06:44 “and those who practiced vile things
01:06:47 to a resurrection of judgment.”
01:06:52 Now, for a few moments, let’s think about those verses
01:06:56 at John 5:28, 29.
01:07:00 Up to now, we have understood Jesus’ words to mean
01:07:04 that the resurrected ones will do “good things”
01:07:09 and that some will do “vile things” after their resurrection.
01:07:14 But notice there in verse 29, Jesus didn’t say
01:07:17 that they will  do these good things
01:07:21 or they will  practice vile things.
01:07:24 He used the past tense, didn’t he?
01:07:26 Because he said that they “did good things”
01:07:30 and that they “practiced vile things.”
01:07:33 So this would indicate to us that these deeds, or actions,
01:07:37 were committed by these ones
01:07:40 prior to their death
01:07:43 and before they would be resurrected.
01:07:46 So that makes sense —doesn’t it?—
01:07:48 because no one is going to be allowed to practice vile things in the new world.
01:07:54 So, what did Jesus mean when he mentioned
01:07:57 these two factors?
01:08:00 Well, for a start, we could say
01:08:02 that the righteous ones still —when they’re resurrected—
01:08:07 have their names written in the book of life.
01:08:11 It’s true that Romans 6:7 says that when someone dies,
01:08:16 his sins are canceled
01:08:18 but (take note of this) not their record of faithfulness.
01:08:23 That’s not canceled.
01:08:24 So the righteous ones are resurrected into the new world,
01:08:29 and their names are still in the book of life.
01:08:34 Of course, they need to remain faithful during the thousand years
01:08:37 to keep their names in that book of life.
01:08:40 But what about the unrighteous ones?
01:08:43 Well, these are the ones who did vile things
01:08:46 before they died.
01:08:48 So when they are resurrected,
01:08:51 they don’t have their names in the book of life.
01:08:53 It’s not a resurrection to life;
01:08:55 it’s a resurrection to judgment.
01:09:00 Now, why do we say that?
01:09:02 Because there we could say that the word “judgment”
01:09:07 is not referring to a condemnation.
01:09:11 It’s not referring to something that is totally negative.
01:09:15 It’s true that at times the word “judgment” can have that meaning.
01:09:19 But in the context of these verses,
01:09:22 it seems that Jesus is using the word “judgment”
01:09:26 in a more neutral sense.
01:09:29 So it means more of an evaluation
01:09:32 or a probation period.
01:09:35 So the unrighteous ones
01:09:38 will have an opportunity to accept this wonderful educational work
01:09:43 that’s going to be done in the new world.
01:09:45 And during that time, they will be evaluated.
01:09:50 And if they dedicate their lives to Jehovah,
01:09:53 then their names will be written into the book of life.
01:09:58 Now at this point, you’re probably thinking,
01:10:01 ‘Hmm, is this an adjustment to our understanding?’
01:10:06 Yes, it is.
01:10:08 So now you’re thinking, ‘Now, can you just run that past me again?’
01:10:14 Well, let’s look at this little summary that will help us.
01:10:18 When Jesus spoke at John 5:29
01:10:21 of those who would receive a resurrection of life,
01:10:26 he was referring to those who did good things
01:10:29 before they died
01:10:31 —those whose names are written in the book of life.
01:10:36 The resurrection of judgment
01:10:38 at John 5:29
01:10:40 involves the resurrection of those
01:10:42 who practice vile things
01:10:44 before they die
01:10:46 and whose names are not yet written
01:10:49 in the book of life.
01:10:52 But whether previously righteous or unrighteous,
01:10:55 all these resurrected ones will need to obey
01:10:58 the laws in the new scrolls
01:11:00 referred to at Revelation 20:12.
01:11:04 There it says: “I saw the dead,
01:11:07 “the great and the small, standing before the throne,
01:11:11 “and scrolls were opened.
01:11:13 “But another scroll was opened;
01:11:15 “it is the scroll of life.
01:11:18 “The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls
01:11:22 according to their deeds.”
01:11:25 Yes, they will be judged individually
01:11:29 “according to their deeds.”
01:11:31 But what deeds?
01:11:34 Will it be their deeds committed before they die?
01:11:37 No.
01:11:39 Otherwise, the resurrection of the unrighteous
01:11:41 would have been a pointless waste.
01:11:44 Here, then, their deeds cannot be deeds from their former life.
01:11:49 Rather, this verse must refer to their deeds
01:11:53 in response to their training in the new world.
01:11:58 Even such faithful men as Noah, Samuel, David, and Daniel
01:12:02 will have to learn about the sacrifice of Christ
01:12:05 and exercise faith in it.
01:12:08 All of this also helps us to understand
01:12:12 an amazing prophecy in the book of Daniel.
01:12:16 Let’s turn there.
01:12:18 It’s Daniel 12:1-3.
01:12:22 There it says: “During that time
01:12:25 “Michael [who is Jesus Christ]
01:12:28 “will stand up [that is, at Armageddon],
01:12:32 “the great prince who is standing
01:12:35 “[since 1914]
01:12:37 “in behalf of your people.
01:12:40 “And there will occur a time of distress
01:12:43 “[that is, the great tribulation]
01:12:45 “such as has not occurred
01:12:47 “since there came to be a nation until that time.
01:12:51 “And during that time your people will escape,
01:12:55 “everyone who is found written down in the book
01:12:59 [and this refers to the great crowd].”
01:13:02 But notice what follows:
01:13:06 “And many of those asleep in the dust of the earth will wake up,
01:13:10 “some to everlasting life
01:13:13 and others to reproach and to everlasting contempt.”
01:13:20 So looking at Daniel 12:2,
01:13:23 it seems appropriate, too, that we adjust
01:13:26 our understanding of this verse.
01:13:29 Notice that there it speaks about people waking up
01:13:32 in the form of a resurrection,
01:13:34 and this occurs after what’s mentioned in verse 1
01:13:37 —after the great crowd survives the great tribulation.
01:13:42 So this obviously is talking about a literal resurrection
01:13:47 of the righteous and unrighteous.
01:13:50 But what does it mean when it mentions there, in verse 2,
01:13:54 that some will be raised to everlasting life
01:13:58 and others to everlasting contempt?
01:14:02 What does that really mean?
01:14:05 Well, when we notice that, we notice that this is a little different
01:14:09 from what Jesus said in John chapter 5 when he spoke about life and judgment.
01:14:13 But now, here he is talking about everlasting  life
01:14:17 and everlasting  contempt.
01:14:21 So that term “everlasting” helps us to realize
01:14:24 that this is talking about the final outcome,
01:14:29 after these ones have had an opportunity
01:14:32 to accept the education.
01:14:34 So those who are resurrected who make good use
01:14:38 of this education,
01:14:40 well, they will continue on and ultimately receive
01:14:43 everlasting life.
01:14:46 But then on the other hand, any who refuse to accept
01:14:49 the benefits of that education
01:14:52 will be judged as worthy of eternal destruction.
01:14:56 Now let’s finally read verse 3:
01:15:02 “And those having insight
01:15:04 “will shine as brightly as the expanse of heaven,
01:15:07 “and those bringing the many to righteousness
01:15:10 like the stars, forever and ever.”
01:15:15 This is speaking about the massive educational work
01:15:18 that will be done in the new world.
01:15:21 The glorified anointed ones will shine brightly
01:15:24 as they work closely with Jesus to direct the education work
01:15:29 that will bring the many to righteousness.
01:15:32 What a joy it will be for them to take part
01:15:35 in this amazing work in their role as priests.
01:15:39 They will assist with “the healing of the nations.”
01:15:43 And what a privilege it will be to see obedient humans
01:15:47 become free from the burden of sin and death and gain perfection!
01:15:58 Of course, we have to realize that at that time on earth,
01:16:02 there won’t be just the resurrected ones, will there?
01:16:05 There will be the survivors of Armageddon
01:16:08 and any children that are born in the new world.
01:16:11 These ones will ultimately attain to perfection.
01:16:16 So is that when they get their names written,
01:16:19 as it were, in ink in the book?
01:16:22 Not quite yet.
01:16:24 Why not?
01:16:26 Well, because perfection doesn’t automatically mean
01:16:30 that someone would get everlasting life.
01:16:32 Remember the case of Adam and Eve: They were perfect.
01:16:35 But before they could attain to everlasting life,
01:16:38 they had to prove their obedience to Jehovah.
01:16:42 Yes.
01:16:43 So we realize, then,
01:16:45 that in the case of Adam and Eve, they failed.
01:16:48 So questions are raised
01:16:51 with regard to all these perfect ones on the earth at that time
01:16:54 (the resurrected ones, the survivors of the great tribulation,
01:16:58 as well as any children that will have been born):
01:17:01 Will they stand faithful?
01:17:04 Will they continue to support Jehovah’s sovereignty?
01:17:08 Or will some of them be like Adam and Eve
01:17:11 —be perfect but then unfaithful?
01:17:15 Well, the book of Revelation helps us to understand
01:17:18 that to answer that question Satan is released from the symbolic prison,
01:17:23 and he has an opportunity
01:17:25 to test the integrity of Jehovah’s servants.
01:17:29 So each person on earth
01:17:31 will have a personal opportunity
01:17:34 to show where they stand on the issue of universal sovereignty.
01:17:39 And their individual response
01:17:42 will show whether or not their names should be written permanently
01:17:46 in the book of life.
01:17:48 Some, an unspecified number,
01:17:51 will turn their backs on Jehovah and will not support his sovereignty.
01:17:55 What will happen to those ones?
01:17:57 Well, Revelation 20:15 tells us, doesn’t it?
01:18:00 Anyone who isn’t “found written in the book of life”
01:18:05 will receive everlasting destruction.
01:18:08 But this is the good news:
01:18:11 The majority of perfect mankind
01:18:14 will find themselves passing the final test.
01:18:18 Yes, and their names will be written permanently
01:18:21 in the book of life.
01:18:23 Isn’t it exciting to think
01:18:26 about what’s going to happen in the future?
01:18:28 Yes, now is the time that Jehovah is preparing his people
01:18:32 for this massive educational work
01:18:35 that is going to take place in the new world.
01:18:38 So now is the time for each one of us to think about that question:
01:18:42 Are you there?
01:18:44 Is your name in the book of life?
01:18:48 Yes, may your name be found written
01:18:51 in Jehovah’s book of life,
01:18:53 and may it remain there forever!
01:19:03 Well, we sincerely thank you, Brother Jackson,
01:19:05 for that very upbuilding and strengthening talk.
01:19:08 I have to say that when the Governing Body
01:19:11 discussed that information,
01:19:14 all of us felt that it was so heartwarming
01:19:19 to think of the time when the anointed will really be able
01:19:22 to work with people on the earth and help them come to perfection.
01:19:27 What a wonderful, wonderful moment that will be!
01:19:31 Well, now we’re primed
01:19:33 for an interesting discussion presented
01:19:35 by another member of the Governing Body, Brother Kenneth Cook.
01:19:38 His theme is
01:19:40 “Are You Heeding the Warnings?”
01:19:46 We live in a time that will end in final judgment
01:19:51 by means of God’s Kingdom.
01:19:53 Jesus described this time
01:19:55 when he gave his disciples a prophetic sign
01:19:58 regarding his invisible presence
01:20:00 at “the conclusion of the system of things.”
01:20:03 Since his prophecy applies to our day,
01:20:07 we should be very interested in its details.
01:20:11 It also points to a bright future
01:20:14 for those who heed its warnings.
01:20:17 We find the prophecy
01:20:19 in Matthew chapters 24 and 25,
01:20:22 Mark chapter 13,
01:20:24 and Luke chapter 21.
01:20:27 After revealing many of the things
01:20:29 that would occur, Jesus provided warnings
01:20:32 for his disciples by means of three parables.
01:20:36 First, he gave the parable of the virgins,
01:20:40 then the parable of the talents,
01:20:44 and finally the parable
01:20:46 of the sheep and the goats.
01:20:49 The parables show how a person’s behavior
01:20:52 will affect his or her final judgment.
01:20:56 The two parables apply to those
01:20:59 (the first two) with the heavenly hope,
01:21:02 and the third parable applies
01:21:04 to those with an earthly hope.
01:21:07 Yet no matter what our hope may be,
01:21:10 all of us can learn from the warnings
01:21:12 found in Jesus’ parables.
01:21:15 Let’s start with the third parable.
01:21:19 In the parable of the sheep and the goats,
01:21:22 Jesus described the final judgment
01:21:24 for sheeplike ones and goatlike ones
01:21:27 during the great tribulation.
01:21:29 As Jehovah’s appointed Judge and King,
01:21:32 Jesus will be completely righteous
01:21:35 in the judgment that he gives.
01:21:37 As a thorough Judge,
01:21:39 he is already observing the actions, attitudes,
01:21:43 and speech of all people,
01:21:45 including how they treat his anointed brothers.
01:21:50 By the start of the great tribulation,
01:21:53 Jesus will have identified those
01:21:55 who are sheeplike or goatlike in their conduct and attitude.
01:22:00 From that time onward,
01:22:02 those who are goatlike will not seek to change.
01:22:05 However, those who are sheeplike
01:22:08 and who have the hope of living forever on earth
01:22:11 will need to remain faithful in order for Jehovah
01:22:15 to keep their names “in the book of life.”
01:22:19 Then, just before Armageddon,
01:22:22 God’s Son will pass final judgment
01:22:24 on all of those then living here on earth.
01:22:27 Persons who are judged to be righteous
01:22:30 will enter into everlasting life on earth.
01:22:34 What a marvelous reward
01:22:36 for those who keep their integrity!
01:22:39 Although Jesus’ third parable
01:22:41 applies to those who hope to live on the earth,
01:22:44 anointed ones too must listen
01:22:46 to the warning message found in that parable.
01:22:49 How so?
01:22:51 Because Jesus is observing their actions,
01:22:54 attitudes, and speech as well.
01:22:57 They too must prove to be righteous and faithful.
01:23:02 Still, a few questions remain.
01:23:05 For example, how are anointed Christians
01:23:08 undergoing a period of judgment today?
01:23:11 And what warnings did Jesus provide for them?
01:23:15 We find the answers to both questions
01:23:17 in the first two parables of Matthew chapter 25.
01:23:22 To prepare us for this review,
01:23:25 let’s briefly consider how anointed Christians are chosen.
01:23:30 We’ll start by looking at a lesson from ancient times.
01:23:35 When the priesthood was established in ancient Israel,
01:23:39 Jehovah decided who would serve as high priest
01:23:42 as well as the underpriests at the tabernacle.
01:23:46 Exodus 28:1 tells us
01:23:48 that he selected “Aaron, along with his sons.”
01:23:52 No one could rightly question Jehovah’s choice,
01:23:56 and those chosen had to prove worthy of their calling.
01:24:01 Similar to what he did back then,
01:24:04 Jehovah chooses those who will serve as priests in heaven.
01:24:08 He began by selecting Jesus
01:24:11 to serve as High Priest.
01:24:14 Although Jesus was a perfect man,
01:24:17 he did not choose that role for himself.
01:24:20 We read at Hebrews 5:5
01:24:24 that “the Christ did not glorify himself
01:24:27 by becoming a high priest.”
01:24:30 Likewise, those who will serve as priests in heaven
01:24:34 do not choose themselves for this assignment.
01:24:38 They are selected by Jehovah
01:24:40 and anointed with his holy spirit.
01:24:43 He knows each one whom he has anointed for this service.
01:24:48 How do faithful anointed ones view their heavenly calling?
01:24:53 When a person is anointed by God,
01:24:57 he or she knows without a doubt that it is from Jehovah
01:25:01 and that one accepts Jehovah’s choice with gratitude.
01:25:06 Instead of feeling proud or haughty,
01:25:08 anointed ones strive
01:25:10 to imitate Jesus’ example of humility.
01:25:14 They’re helped to do so by keeping in mind
01:25:18 the lessons and warnings
01:25:20 that are found in Jesus’ parables for them.
01:25:24 It’s noteworthy that just before relating his parables,
01:25:29 Jesus spoke about a “faithful and discreet slave”
01:25:32 who would distribute spiritual food
01:25:34 at the proper time during the last days.
01:25:38 That slave pictures a small group
01:25:41 of anointed Christian men today, the Governing Body.
01:25:45 For their faithful service, Jesus said
01:25:48 that there would be a reward, but he also provided a warning.
01:25:53 He spoke about what would happen
01:25:55 if that slave ever lost sight of Jesus’ future return
01:25:59 and started to mistreat his fellow slaves.
01:26:02 If that were to happen,
01:26:05 that slave would be viewed as evil and would,
01:26:09 as Matthew 24:51 states,
01:26:11 be ‘punished with the greatest severity.’
01:26:15 Please note that Jesus was not prophesying
01:26:20 that there would be an evil slave.
01:26:23 This is a warning, not a prophecy.
01:26:27 What was the warning?
01:26:29 That the faithful slave needs to remain watchful.
01:26:33 Yet, it is not just “the faithful and discreet slave”
01:26:36 who must remain watchful.
01:26:39 By means of his parables, Jesus warned
01:26:42 that all anointed ones must likewise prove
01:26:45 to be discreet, faithful, and watchful.
01:26:50 Now, how did Jesus make his point?
01:26:53 In the parable of the virgins, Jesus spoke
01:26:57 of ten virgins who went out to meet a bridegroom.
01:27:00 They hoped to accompany the bridegroom into his marriage feast.
01:27:04 Jesus described five of the virgins
01:27:07 as discreet and five as foolish.
01:27:12 The Greek word used for “discreet”
01:27:14 conveys the idea of understanding,
01:27:17 forethought, discernment, and wisdom
01:27:21 in a practical sense.
01:27:23 So the discreet virgins were wise,
01:27:27 and they showed this by being ready
01:27:29 when the bridegroom arrived in the middle of the night.
01:27:33 They had lamps to light their way.
01:27:35 And Matthew 25:4 adds that “the discreet [virgins]
01:27:40 took oil in their flasks along with their lamps.”
01:27:45 So they had the means to keep their lamps burning.
01:27:50 Because they proved to be ready,
01:27:52 they could follow the bridegroom into his marriage feast.
01:27:56 This action depicts genuine anointed ones
01:28:00 entering into their heavenly reward.
01:28:02 They will be judged as worthy
01:28:04 to join the Bridegroom, Jesus, in his heavenly Kingdom.
01:28:09 But what about the foolish virgins?
01:28:13 Well, unlike the discreet virgins,
01:28:15 the foolish ones were not ready when the bridegroom arrived.
01:28:19 Their lamps died out.
01:28:21 As a result, they could not follow the bridegroom
01:28:24 and enter into his marriage feast.
01:28:27 When they later tried to do so,
01:28:29 they heard the bridegroom tell them:
01:28:32 “I do not know you.”
01:28:35 What is the lesson and warning
01:28:38 that Jesus was illustrating?
01:28:41 He was showing that only anointed Christians
01:28:44 who “keep on the watch” and prove to be ready
01:28:46 will follow him into the reward.
01:28:50 Notice, though, that Jesus did not say
01:28:52 that there would be a large number of foolish ones
01:28:55 who would be unprepared when he comes in this way
01:28:58 at the great tribulation.
01:29:00 Here, too, this is a warning, not a prophecy.
01:29:04 We’re not focused on five of them being discreet
01:29:07 and five of them being foolish.
01:29:11 Jesus was simply letting anointed ones know
01:29:13 what would happen if they failed to “keep on the watch.”
01:29:18 That is a sobering thought.
01:29:22 Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,
01:29:25 all true Christians should listen to the warning
01:29:28 found in the parable of the virgins.
01:29:31 We must “keep on the watch”
01:29:33 and always be ready
01:29:36 to carry out our service to God.
01:29:40 Now, after using the parable of the virgins
01:29:43 to emphasize the need to be discreet,
01:29:46 Jesus related a parable that highlights the need to be faithful.
01:29:51 It is the parable of the talents, or money.
01:29:55 In this parable, Jesus tells about two slaves
01:29:59 who were faithful to their master
01:30:01 and one slave who was not.
01:30:04 How did the two slaves prove to be faithful?
01:30:07 Well, the faithful slaves worked hard
01:30:09 to increase the money that their master entrusted to their care
01:30:13 just before he traveled abroad.
01:30:15 When he returned, the faithful slaves
01:30:19 had more to give back than what they had received
01:30:22 and they were blessed for doing so.
01:30:25 But what about the third slave, the sluggish one?
01:30:29 What did he do with what he had received?
01:30:32 Well, the sluggish slave buried what he had been given
01:30:35 and failed to increase his master’s talents.
01:30:39 When the master returned, that slave had nothing additional
01:30:42 to give to his master.
01:30:44 He even tried to blame the master,
01:30:46 calling him “a demanding man.”
01:30:49 As a result, that slave did not receive greater blessings.
01:30:54 More than that, what he had been given
01:30:58 was taken away from him,
01:31:00 and he was cast out of the master’s household.
01:31:04 What did the master’s response mean for each of his slaves,
01:31:08 and whom do they picture today?
01:31:12 The two faithful slaves depict anointed Christians
01:31:16 who proved to be valued members of the master’s household.
01:31:20 The Master, Jesus, invites them
01:31:24 to “enter into the joy of [their] master.”
01:31:27 That joy pictures their heavenly reward.
01:31:31 On the other hand, the bad example of the sluggish slave
01:31:35 provides a warning for anointed ones.
01:31:38 How so?
01:31:40 If anointed ones do not remain alert and watchful,
01:31:44 they could become self-satisfied with what they have received.
01:31:48 They might not extend themselves in Kingdom service.
01:31:52 They could lose sight of their responsibilities
01:31:55 and fail to do as 2 Peter 1:10 urges,
01:31:59 where they are told “to make the calling
01:32:02 and choosing sure for themselves.”
01:32:06 If any of them become like the sluggish slave,
01:32:09 they would not be approved to enter into the heavenly Kingdom
01:32:12 and share in the joy of the Master.
01:32:15 Once again,
01:32:17 Jesus was providing a warning, not a prophecy.
01:32:22 Clearly, all anointed Christians
01:32:24 must strive to be both discreet and faithful.
01:32:30 Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,
01:32:33 all true Christians are determined to remain faithful to Jehovah.
01:32:38 We are secure in our relationship with him.
01:32:42 We’re not concerned if Jehovah
01:32:44 chooses to anoint some faithful ones in more recent years.
01:32:48 We recall what Jesus said regarding the “11th-hour” workers
01:32:53 in his illustration about the vineyard.
01:32:56 You can read about it in Matthew chapter 20.
01:33:00 Those who were invited to work in the vineyard later in the day
01:33:04 received the same reward from the master of the vineyard
01:33:08 as those who were invited to work in it earlier in the day.
01:33:12 Likewise, Jehovah and his Son know how many anointed ones to call
01:33:17 in order to complete the number of 144,000
01:33:21 before the end comes.
01:33:23 But no matter when they are selected,
01:33:26 each anointed one who is judged to be faithful
01:33:29 will receive their heavenly reward.
01:33:32 Now with that in mind, let’s consider
01:33:34 Matthew 24:40, 41.
01:33:40 And as we do, we’ll see how these verses
01:33:43 connect to Jesus’ parables for the anointed.
01:33:47 At Matthew 24:40, it reads:
01:33:50 “Then two men will be in the field;
01:33:53 “one will be taken along and the other abandoned.
01:33:57 “Two women will be grinding at the hand mill;
01:34:00 one will be taken along and the other abandoned.”
01:34:07 Did you notice some similarities to the parables?
01:34:10 Jesus spoke of two men working in a field
01:34:13 and of two women working at a hand mill.
01:34:17 Outwardly, they appear to be the same.
01:34:20 But in each case, Jesus said that “one [would] be taken along
01:34:25 and the other abandoned.”
01:34:28 He then urged his followers to “keep on the watch, therefore,
01:34:32 because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.”
01:34:37 Jesus said something very similar
01:34:40 after relating the parable of the virgins.
01:34:43 In both examples, he provided a warning.
01:34:48 Since the parable of the virgins applies to anointed Christians,
01:34:52 do Jesus’ comments about those who are taken along
01:34:55 also apply to the anointed?
01:34:57 It appears that they do.
01:34:59 And here again, Jesus was providing a warning.
01:35:04 In his great prophecy regarding “the conclusion of the system of things,”
01:35:08 we find that Jesus lovingly highlights
01:35:12 both the good news of the Kingdom,
01:35:14 as well as warning messages for all people,
01:35:17 including his followers.
01:35:20 Down to this day, our message follows the same pattern.
01:35:24 It is both one of salvation as well as one of warning.
01:35:29 And we must continue to do all that we can
01:35:32 to deliver Jesus’ twofold message
01:35:34 and help others to act on it while there is still time.
01:35:38 Clearly, Jehovah and his Son want us
01:35:42 to remain discreet, faithful, and on the watch.
01:35:47 So, what have we considered?
01:35:50 Some of the virgins in Jesus’ illustration
01:35:53 found out that the door was shut,
01:35:55 and they heard the bridegroom tell them:
01:35:57 “I do not know you.”
01:36:00 One of the slaves in Jesus’ illustration of the talents
01:36:03 did not enter into his master’s joy
01:36:05 but was thrown outside into the darkness.
01:36:09 Jesus also indicated
01:36:11 that not all would be taken along into the heavenly reward.
01:36:16 What a serious warning for those who have the heavenly hope!
01:36:20 Even so, we are confident
01:36:22 that the full number of them will be filled.
01:36:26 Truly, this is a time of judgment for all of God’s people,
01:36:31 including the righteous sheep who yearn to live forever on earth.
01:36:36 But there is no reason for any of us
01:36:38 to fear the final judgment that is yet ahead.
01:36:42 Our loving heavenly Father promises to give us
01:36:45 “power beyond what is normal” so that we may,
01:36:50 as Luke 21:36 says,
01:36:53 “succeed in . . . standing before the Son of man.”
01:36:57 So then, whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,
01:37:02 we must heed the warnings found in Jesus’ parables
01:37:07 and thereby keep our names “written in the book of life.”
01:37:18 We thank you so much, Brother Cook,
01:37:20 for that excellent review of warnings
01:37:23 that we need to keep in our minds.
01:37:25 Well, did you capture all of the fine points
01:37:29 of those three talks?
01:37:31 We’re now going to pass out the exam sheets.
01:37:35 No, just kidding.
01:37:37 But if you would like to review
01:37:39 those talks carefully, and we know you will,
01:37:42 guess what?
01:37:44 They’re going to be presented to the worldwide brotherhood
01:37:47 in the January monthly edition of JW Broadcasting.
01:37:52 So you all will have the opportunity to carefully review your notes
01:37:56 to make sure you got all the fine points in those wonderful, wonderful talks.
01:38:01 Well, the Governing Body has asked that a brief update
01:38:05 about the construction of the Ramapo headquarters facility
01:38:08 be shared with you at this time.
01:38:10 Now, despite the pandemic,
01:38:12 we have clearly seen Jehovah’s hand on the Ramapo project this year,
01:38:17 so please enjoy the following visual update.
01:38:25 Before the main project begins,
01:38:27 contractors have already been assisting to repair and strengthen
01:38:31 an existing stone-faced bridge on the road into the site.
01:38:36 When completed,
01:38:37 the restoration of this structure
01:38:39 will serve as a beautiful feature of the property.
01:38:43 More important,
01:38:45 Jehovah has greatly blessed the efforts to work through the planning process
01:38:49 with the town of Ramapo.
01:38:52 That process is now in the final stages of obtaining
01:38:56 the necessary permits to start the large, new construction project.
01:39:02 In the first quarter of 2022, Jehovah willing,
01:39:06 contractors will start clearing the site
01:39:09 in preparation for earth-moving
01:39:12 and installation of underground utilities
01:39:15 and for readying the locations
01:39:17 where the first buildings  will be constructed.
01:39:20 This in itself will take many months,
01:39:23 and we look to Jehovah to bless this key phase that, when concluded,
01:39:28 will open up the project
01:39:30 for many volunteers to come and share in the work.
01:39:35 Much forethought and work has gone into the arrangements needed for feeding,
01:39:40 housing, and providing temporary office spaces
01:39:44 for all such willing brothers and sisters.
01:39:49 The design team is fully engaged in preparing the construction documents.
01:39:53 The drawings for some buildings are well-advanced;
01:39:56 others are in the concept stage.
01:39:59 No doubt, seeing these concept images
01:40:02 of the future Ramapo facility
01:40:05 is exciting and encouraging to all of you.
01:40:15 Well, with all of you, we continue to pray that Jehovah will bless
01:40:20 this very exciting theocratic project.
01:40:25 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,
01:40:28 we have felt Jehovah’s loving care
01:40:30 as we’ve received helpful direction
01:40:33 just at the right time.
01:40:36 Please listen and watch
01:40:38 as those who work in the Coordinators’ Committee Office
01:40:41 recount how events unfolded with the pandemic
01:40:45 and how Jehovah has guided matters throughout this time.
01:40:52 In January of 2020,
01:40:54 we started seeing news reports
01:40:56 about a disease outbreak in Wuhan, China.
01:41:00 Now at the time, it seemed localized and was not of global concern.
01:41:04 But a short time later,
01:41:06 the numbers were going up
01:41:07 as the virus began to spread.
01:41:10 Borders were closing, and airports were shutting down.
01:41:19 On January 22, the Coordinators’ Committee
01:41:21 received their first letter from a branch
01:41:23 about the coronavirus.
01:41:25 The letter was from the Korea branch.
01:41:27 Soon after that,
01:41:28 we wrote to all branches in and around Asia
01:41:31 and included guidelines on what to do
01:41:33 if they had an outbreak in their territory.
01:41:35 We had dealt with local epidemics before
01:41:38 but nothing like this on a worldwide scale.
01:41:41 It was clear that the virus was going to affect almost every aspect
01:41:45 of our theocratic operations.
01:41:47 And during those first few months of 2020,
01:41:49 the organization would be faced with a huge amount of decisions.
01:41:53 You have to realize that this was catching us
01:41:56 right in the middle of our activities.
01:41:59 Our schedule for the whole year had already been planned.
01:42:03 We had shepherding visits to branches, regional conventions,
01:42:07 even special conventions.
01:42:09 And now we had Gilead graduation
01:42:12 and Memorial coming up right in front of us.
01:42:15 What were we going to do?
01:42:17 One of the first things
01:42:19 the Governing Body decided
01:42:21 was that the Coordinators’ Committee
01:42:23 would become the central channel
01:42:26 of communication regarding COVID-19.
01:42:31 Meanwhile, the graduation
01:42:33 of the 148th class of Gilead
01:42:36 was in two weeks.
01:42:38 Should we have guests come?
01:42:40 Should there be a live audience?
01:42:43 There was not much time to make these decisions.
01:42:47 However, after prayer and discussion,
01:42:51 the entire Governing Body decided
01:42:54 not to have a live audience
01:42:56 for the Gilead graduation that weekend.
01:43:00 That was unheard of!
01:43:03 The next thing we needed to figure out
01:43:05 was whether to lock down headquarters at Bethel.
01:43:08 I clearly remember it was a Friday night,
01:43:11 March 13.
01:43:13 We were getting reports of COVID cases
01:43:15 in the congregations around Bethel.
01:43:17 And we also knew that the Bethelites
01:43:19 would be going out to their congregation and other activities over the weekend.
01:43:23 If we were going to do something, we needed to do it quickly.
01:43:27 We called each member of the Governing Body
01:43:30 and explained the situation.
01:43:32 And all were unanimous
01:43:35 that we should lock down Bethel immediately.
01:43:39 So within the hour, a message went to the entire headquarters
01:43:42 and United States Bethel family to stay in,
01:43:45 and if you were out, to return to Bethel immediately.
01:43:49 Sometime later,
01:43:51 we learned that there were some COVID cases at Patterson.
01:43:56 If we had moved ahead, potentially we could have spread COVID
01:44:00 through the whole Bethel family!
01:44:03 We really felt Jehovah’s protective hand.
01:44:08 The same weekend as the Gilead graduation,
01:44:11 the Memorial invitation campaign
01:44:13 was scheduled to begin.
01:44:14 And so branches were asking:
01:44:17 Is it safe to go door to door and to distribute invitations?
01:44:20 What if we can’t meet at our Kingdom Halls?
01:44:23 As the virus had spread in many countries,
01:44:26 it became evident
01:44:28 that we needed to suspend the public ministry.
01:44:33 This was a very serious decision.
01:44:37 But when we prayerfully analyzed the situation,
01:44:42 we realized we would not be showing respect
01:44:45 for the sanctity of life or love of neighbor
01:44:49 if we continued house to house.
01:44:52 Our preaching work shifted to letter writing
01:44:55 and telephone witnessing.
01:44:58 And what a huge witness has been given in this way!
01:45:02 It was amazing to me personally when I saw how quickly
01:45:06 the brothers could adapt to using
01:45:08 Zoom, phone witnessing, letter writing.
01:45:11 And instead of it being a huge setback for the work,
01:45:14 it was almost as though the work even moved ahead.
01:45:18 We were also having to deal
01:45:20 with what to do about our Kingdom Halls and our meetings.
01:45:23 Initially, some of the brothers were thinking,
01:45:26 ‘Maybe we could just simply watch the prerecorded meetings
01:45:29 on JW Stream ®.’
01:45:31 Well, while that’s an excellent provision,
01:45:35 if we were going to do this for a long time,
01:45:38 it would be wonderful to use a tool
01:45:42 that would allow the brothers and sisters to come together virtually,
01:45:45 to be able to interact and have that “interchange of encouragement.”
01:45:49 We knew that a few branches had already started using Zoom
01:45:54 for congregation meetings,
01:45:56 and we wondered, ‘Could this tool be used
01:46:00 for congregation meetings globally?’
01:46:03 So we asked those branches
01:46:04 for their recommendations
01:46:05 on how we could use this tool further.
01:46:08 We got their comments, we did some testing,
01:46:11 and then the Governing Body approved the global use of Zoom  for meetings.
01:46:15 At the same time, though,
01:46:16 the Coordinators’ Committee urgently wanted
01:46:18 to help those congregations to arrange
01:46:20 dignified Zoom  meetings.
01:46:21 And so within a week, technical and theocratic guidelines
01:46:25 were released to all congregations.
01:46:27 And shortly after that,
01:46:29 tens of thousands of Zoom  licenses were purchased
01:46:32 and then provided to many congregations as part of the disaster relief arrangement.
01:46:36 However, not all publishers could use Zoom  because of lack of Internet.
01:46:41 So in the days leading up to the campaign,
01:46:43 the Governing Body provided direction to all branches
01:46:46 on how to handle those exact situations.
01:46:49 They also announced that the Memorial talk itself
01:46:52 would be made available on jw.org.
01:46:55 So one branch wrote in and asked if they could use
01:46:58 television and radio broadcasting.
01:47:01 And we thought: ‘That’s a good idea.
01:47:03 Let’s try it.’
01:47:05 Once we saw how well it worked in that country,
01:47:07 television and radio were approved
01:47:10 for all branches in Africa
01:47:12 only two days before the Memorial.
01:47:14 How thrilling it was for many friends in Africa
01:47:18 to find out, even moments before the broadcast began,
01:47:21 that they would be able to commemorate the Memorial
01:47:24 simultaneously with their brothers and sisters throughout the country!
01:47:28 To have the Memorial without being able to meet together
01:47:31 was so different for all of us.
01:47:34 Can you imagine that for the 2021 Memorial
01:47:38 there was an all-time peak
01:47:40 of 21,367,603?
01:47:48 Clearly, we have seen Jehovah’s blessing
01:47:52 on these arrangements.
01:47:55 While all these new arrangements
01:47:57 were being made at a rapid pace,
01:48:00 the usual work of the Coordinators’ Committee Office
01:48:02 didn’t stop because of the pandemic.
01:48:05 We still had to deal with the king of the north
01:48:07 persecuting our brothers.
01:48:09 We still had disasters and many other things to contend with.
01:48:13 In fact, we handled twice as many disasters
01:48:17 in the 2020 service year
01:48:19 in the middle of the pandemic
01:48:20 than we did in 2018.
01:48:23 On a daily basis, we saw clear evidence
01:48:26 that we are living in the last days.
01:48:28 We had to come up with guidelines
01:48:30 to help branches determine
01:48:31 what aspects of relief work
01:48:32 could be postponed
01:48:34 and at the same time ensure that urgent or necessary work went ahead safely.
01:48:38 While there’s no doubt that the pandemic
01:48:40 complicated disaster relief efforts considerably,
01:48:42 it was so faith-strengthening to see
01:48:45 that the Governing Body refused
01:48:46 to allow those complications to prevent them from caring for our brothers.
01:48:50 In addition to the impact these disasters had on our brothers,
01:48:54 in some countries our brothers
01:48:56 couldn’t even get enough food for their daily needs.
01:48:59 This could have been because of government restrictions, supply issues,
01:49:03 or other circumstances that wouldn’t allow the brothers to work.
01:49:08 Literally, the branches had to arrange to provide their “daily bread.”
01:49:13 Branches were encouraged to establish disaster relief committees
01:49:17 to care for the needs on a local level.
01:49:20 Reminders were provided to help families
01:49:23 try to prepare a reserve of food, if at all possible,
01:49:26 in case the situation became worse.
01:49:29 Of course, the virus affected not only our meetings at the Kingdom Hall
01:49:33 but also our circuit assemblies,
01:49:35 regional conventions, and special conventions.
01:49:39 So the Governing Body decided to cancel
01:49:43 all live regional and special conventions
01:49:46 for 2020.
01:49:50 That lead to a landmark convention program
01:49:53 on jw.org
01:49:56 that the entire brotherhood enjoyed.
01:50:00 That same week in March,
01:50:03 we approved that a JW Broadcasting® news release
01:50:07 about the coronavirus outbreak
01:50:09 be developed.
01:50:11 So interviews and scripts were prepared
01:50:15 during that Gilead graduation weekend,
01:50:18 and the program was recorded and released
01:50:22 the following week.
01:50:25 The Governing Body updates
01:50:27 have been an important way for us to shepherd
01:50:31 the entire organization during the pandemic.
01:50:35 Well, once vaccinations became more prevalent,
01:50:38 we faced another challenge.
01:50:40 The United States branch was struggling to get vaccines
01:50:43 for those in the Bethel family who wanted them.
01:50:46 So in early April 2021, we called together a meeting.
01:50:50 We had all the key individuals there from the various departments,
01:50:54 and everyone was given an assignment.
01:50:57 And within two weeks, we had enough vaccines
01:51:02 to vaccinate everyone in the U.S. Bethel family
01:51:05 who chose to be vaccinated.
01:51:07 Well, about a week later, we sent a letter to all branches,
01:51:10 encouraging them to investigate the availability of vaccines
01:51:13 for special full-time servants.
01:51:14 We were especially concerned about special full-time servants
01:51:18 serving in lands where the government was not yet making vaccines available.
01:51:21 After that direction went out,
01:51:24 we had a tremendous response from a number of branches
01:51:28 who were able to obtain vaccines for special full-time servants
01:51:32 who wanted to receive them.
01:51:34 Several branches said that it had seemed impossible
01:51:38 to get vaccines in their country at that moment,
01:51:41 but they prayed about it, they followed the direction,
01:51:45 and then either that same day or the very next day
01:51:49 Jehovah opened the doors and suddenly they had the vaccine.
01:51:54 All of these events occurred rapidly,
01:51:56 and even though it was difficult
01:51:59 to make so many adjustments
01:52:01 in such a short period of time,
01:52:03 we could see Jehovah’s hand
01:52:05 in the Governing Body’s decisions.
01:52:08 Television, radio, videoconferencing
01:52:11 have all served our brothers well,
01:52:13 which just goes to show that Jehovah was guiding the Governing Body
01:52:17 as they made these decisions so early in the pandemic.
01:52:20 You know, we’ve always appreciated
01:52:23 the direction we receive from the faithful slave.
01:52:25 But at that unique time especially,
01:52:28 it was so encouraging to see Jehovah use them
01:52:31 to make these major decisions.
01:52:33 And they made many that one week in March.
01:52:36 Although there have been many challenges
01:52:39 and sad times during the pandemic,
01:52:41 it’s been amazing
01:52:43 to see many positive developments.
01:52:48 So many inactive ones have returned.
01:52:50 So many Bible studies have been started.
01:52:55 We saw how Jehovah guided us through
01:52:58 —decision by decision, step-by-step.
01:53:02 And seeing how Jehovah led us through this situation
01:53:06 has helped me to see that regardless of what is going to come up in the future,
01:53:10 Jehovah is going to do the same thing.
01:53:12 Like the Scriptures say, we get our plagues.
01:53:15 We have those times.
01:53:16 But overall, when you’re in Jehovah’s arms,
01:53:20 what’s the worry?
01:53:22 You could say that every one of the Governing Body’s faith
01:53:24 was strengthened as we got through this trial,
01:53:28 and it’s just a continuous thing of our faith being built up.
01:53:32 And how Jehovah is directing us!
01:53:35 And he’s preparing his people
01:53:37 for life in that new world
01:53:39 —the real life that’s coming.
01:53:42 It’s been a real privilege to see Jehovah’s spirit in action
01:53:45 during this pandemic.
01:53:47 It’s strengthened our faith to see him use the Governing Body
01:53:51 to provide Scripturally based direction and keep the Kingdom work going,
01:53:55 all the while showing respect for life.
01:53:59 As a result, our trust in Jehovah’s organization
01:54:02 is stronger than ever before.
01:54:05 And building this trust now is vital
01:54:08 because Jehovah is preparing us for future events,
01:54:12 including the great tribulation.
01:54:22 Well, we take this opportunity to thank
01:54:25 all of the brothers who work in the Coordinators’ Committee Office
01:54:28 for the hard work that they put forward during the pandemic.
01:54:31 It was just amazing to see how many ways
01:54:35 Jehovah has directed matters during these challenging times.
01:54:40 What an encouraging program!
01:54:43 And that was just the first half.
01:54:45 There’s so much more to enjoy.
01:54:48 We’ll see you here next month for the rest of the program.
01:54:51 But before we go,
01:54:53 we’d like to meet our brothers and sisters in the Philippines
01:54:57 in this month’s video postcard.
01:55:00 The Philippines is a tropical country in the western Pacific Ocean
01:55:05 that’s made up of more than 7,100 islands.
01:55:10 Across those islands,
01:55:12 you’ll find an astonishing diversity of landscapes
01:55:16 —from pristine beaches
01:55:18 and lush farmlands
01:55:20 to dramatic mountain ranges.
01:55:23 There are also bustling cities,
01:55:26 including the capital, Manila
01:55:28 —one of the most densely populated cities in the world.
01:55:32 The over 230,000 publishers
01:55:36 living in the Philippines
01:55:37 preach to a population
01:55:39 of more than 109 million people.
01:55:43 In 2021,
01:55:46 739,439
01:55:50 attended the Memorial.
01:55:52 That’s more than three times the number of publishers.
01:55:56 Let’s travel to the southern part of the country
01:55:59 to one of the largest islands,
01:56:01 Mindanao.
01:56:04 Here farmers grow staples like corn and rice
01:56:08 along with cacao, pomelo,
01:56:10 and durian —a popular Asian fruit
01:56:14 famous for its unusual, pungent smell.
01:56:18 The southern tip of Mindanao is home
01:56:21 to the 97 publishers in the Margus Congregation.
01:56:25 In this remote part of the country,
01:56:28 the pandemic posed some unique challenges.
01:56:32 Because of unreliable Internet service,
01:56:35 the congregation chose to schedule its meetings on Zoom
01:56:39 at 3:30 a.m.
01:56:42 Why so early?
01:56:43 The Internet signal is more stable
01:56:47 during those early hours of the morning.
01:56:50 The publishers may have missed out on a few hours of sleep,
01:56:54 but they didn’t miss any of the spiritual food
01:56:57 being provided through the meetings.
01:57:00 In other areas served by the congregation,
01:57:03 there’s no Internet or cell service at all,
01:57:07 so the brothers listen to meetings broadcast over radio.
01:57:12 But those challenges haven’t dampened their zeal,
01:57:15 especially when it comes to sharing the good news
01:57:19 with the indigenous population.
01:57:22 Since 2019,
01:57:24 the congregation has been hosting
01:57:26 a B’laan-language group.
01:57:29 B’laan is an indigenous language
01:57:31 spoken by about 125,000 people.
01:57:35 The B’laan people
01:57:37 are famous for their handicrafts
01:57:39 and colorful native costumes.
01:57:42 With several publications and videos
01:57:45 now available in B’laan,
01:57:47 native speakers can hear the truth
01:57:50 in their own language.
01:57:52 The 28 brothers and sisters
01:57:55 of the B’laan group
01:57:57 in the Margus Congregation
01:57:59 would like to send you their warm love and greetings.
01:58:03 And please remember, dear brothers and sisters,
01:58:07 we love you all very much.
