00:00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®!
00:00:04 What do we have in store for you?
00:00:06 Here are some highlights.
00:00:08 DiDi Brown lost her daughter in an unimaginable tragedy.
00:00:13 How did Jehovah comfort her?
00:00:16 Racial and national prejudice is hard to overcome for some people.
00:00:20 We’ll go to Greece and see a beautiful example
00:00:25 of impartial love in action.
00:00:27 And our new song reminds us
00:00:29 that when we make time for Jehovah,
00:00:31 we feel his presence in our life.
00:00:34 This is JW Broadcasting for March 2022.
00:00:59 There is no doubt that we’re living
00:01:01 in “critical times hard to deal with,”
00:01:05 just as the apostle Paul prophesied
00:01:07 under inspiration in 2 Timothy chapter 3.
00:01:12 Many times, we’ve read Matthew chapter 24,
00:01:16 Mark chapter 13, Luke chapter 21,
00:01:19 and Revelation chapter 6.
00:01:23 But who would ever have known
00:01:25 how deeply a pandemic,
00:01:28 so-called natural disasters, violence, and unrest
00:01:33 would affect us economically,
00:01:36 physically, and even emotionally?
00:01:40 Some of you dear friends face unimaginable hardships.
00:01:45 Many have experienced loss of loved ones,
00:01:49 imprisonment, physical abuse,
00:01:52 sickness, financial problems,
00:01:54 and sometimes a number of these
00:01:57 or other circumstances all at the same time.
00:02:02 You dear brothers and sisters are in our prayers.
00:02:07 With this in mind, the theme for our program
00:02:10 is “In Difficult Times,
00:02:13 Jehovah Always Comforts.”
00:02:17 A scripture that’s become familiar to Jehovah’s people
00:02:20 is 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4:
00:02:26 “Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00:02:31 “the Father of tender mercies
00:02:34 “and the God of all comfort,
00:02:36 “who comforts us in all our trials
00:02:39 “so that we may be able to comfort others
00:02:42 “in any sort of trial with the comfort
00:02:45 that we receive from God.”
00:02:48 The Study Bible  says this
00:02:51 regarding the expression “the Father of tender mercies”:
00:02:56 “The Greek noun rendered ‘tender mercies’ . . .
00:02:59 “is here used to describe a feeling of compassion,
00:03:03 “or pity, for others.
00:03:05 “God is called the Father, or the Source, of tender mercies
00:03:10 “because compassion emanates from him and is part of his nature.
00:03:16 “Such tender feelings move him
00:03:19 “to act mercifully in behalf of his faithful servants
00:03:22 who are suffering tribulation.”
00:03:26 Regarding the phrase, “the God of all comfort,”
00:03:29 it continues: “The Greek noun . . . here rendered ‘comfort,’
00:03:34 “literally means ‘a calling to one’s side.’
00:03:37 “It conveys the idea of standing next to a person,
00:03:41 “helping or encouraging him
00:03:43 “when he is undergoing trials or feeling sad. . . .
00:03:46 “God uses his powerful active force
00:03:49 “to give comfort and help in situations
00:03:53 that from a human viewpoint seem hopeless.”
00:03:58 Think about what that means.
00:04:00 Jehovah wants us to know that whatever we face,
00:04:05 he is by our side, helping us
00:04:08 when we’re undergoing any sort of trial.
00:04:11 No, he did not promise that he’d remove our trials.
00:04:14 Rather, he eases our misery, or grief,
00:04:19 whenever we undergo difficulties.
00:04:22 What a beautiful word picture of God standing next to us,
00:04:27 especially when things seem hopeless!
00:04:31 We invite you to do a personal study project.
00:04:34 Using the publication Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:04:38 or the Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™,
00:04:41 do a word search on “comfort.”
00:04:44 You will be drawn even closer to Jehovah
00:04:48 and appreciate his unmatched desire
00:04:52 and ability to comfort.
00:04:56 Jehovah also inspired Paul to show
00:04:59 how he would stand by us to comfort us.
00:05:04 Notice Romans 15:4:
00:05:09 “For all the things that were written beforehand
00:05:13 “were written for our instruction,
00:05:16 “so that through our endurance
00:05:19 “and through the comfort from the Scriptures
00:05:22 we might have hope.”
00:05:25 “Comfort from the Scriptures”
00:05:28 —time limits us from going into all of the ways
00:05:31 that the Bible does this.
00:05:33 But let’s take some examples.
00:05:36 A scripture that Jehovah’s people have often meditated on in recent times
00:05:41 is found in Jeremiah chapter 29.
00:05:47 When Jehovah inspired Jeremiah to convey his message to the Jews,
00:05:52 they had been taken from Jerusalem
00:05:55 and were captives in Babylon.
00:05:58 They were downhearted.
00:06:00 But even while in captivity,
00:06:02 Jehovah provided a comforting message.
00:06:05 Notice his words
00:06:08 at Jeremiah 29:10:
00:06:10 “When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,
00:06:14 I will turn my attention to you.”
00:06:18 God told these Jewish exiles
00:06:21 that they would remain in captivity for a long time.
00:06:25 Then he made it clear to them that he had a peaceful future in mind.
00:06:30 The latter part of that verse says:
00:06:33 “And I will make good my promise
00:06:36 by bringing you back to this place.”
00:06:38 In verse 11, he says:
00:06:40 “‘I well know the thoughts
00:06:42 “that I am thinking toward you,’
00:06:44 “declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace,
00:06:47 “‘and not of calamity,
00:06:49 to give you a future and a hope.’”
00:06:53 God did make good on his promise to those Israelites.
00:06:57 He let them know that their future was to be a bright one.
00:07:02 Regarding Jeremiah 29:11,
00:07:06 one commentary states:
00:07:10 “It is difficult to find a more wonderful promise
00:07:14 “anywhere in Scripture that expresses the tender compassion
00:07:18 “of Yahweh [Jehovah]
00:07:21 “toward these exiles and setting before them, at last,
00:07:24 a real reason for optimism and expectation.”
00:07:29 Jehovah’s promise strengthened men
00:07:32 such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.
00:07:37 Jehovah reassured the Jews by repeating his promise
00:07:41 at Jeremiah 31:17:
00:07:45 “And there is a hope for your future . . .
00:07:48 Your sons will return to their own territory.”
00:07:53 Sure enough, just as Jehovah foretold,
00:07:58 Babylon was conquered by the Persian King Cyrus,
00:08:01 who allowed the exiled Jews to return to their homeland.
00:08:05 After 70 years of captivity,
00:08:09 they were back in Jerusalem.
00:08:11 Jehovah ‘made good on his promise.’
00:08:16 What does that have to do with us today?
00:08:20 The fulfilled promises of Jehovah assure us
00:08:24 that his promises to us will come true
00:08:28 in spite of surrounding circumstances.
00:08:31 As he said: “I will make good my promise.”
00:08:35 How comforting to know that!
00:08:37 But we know that the greatest expression of Jehovah’s comfort
00:08:42 is his only-begotten Son, Jesus.
00:08:47 During his time on earth, he gave people hope.
00:08:51 Jesus engaged in a marvelous ministry
00:08:54 —healing the sick, performing powerful works
00:08:57 and, most important, teaching people about God’s Kingdom.
00:09:03 However, the greatest expression of hope to us humans
00:09:08 is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.
00:09:12 Through his inspired Word,
00:09:15 we can see that Jehovah assures us
00:09:18 that he not only understands what we face
00:09:22 but also desires to console and strengthen us.
00:09:27 Our loving heavenly Father
00:09:30 especially watches over all who endeavor to do his will.
00:09:34 But in all of his mercy,
00:09:36 he also draws humble people who may not yet know him.
00:09:41 How many of us were in dire straits
00:09:45 only to be introduced to the truth
00:09:47 and to get to know Jehovah at the right time?
00:09:51 That was no coincidence.
00:09:53 That’s a consequence of Jehovah’s love
00:09:56 and his desire to give people comfort through the hope he provides.
00:10:03 Dear brothers and sisters,
00:10:06 as we get closer to the great tribulation,
00:10:10 we will face more distressing circumstances.
00:10:13 And during the great tribulation,
00:10:16 our trust in Jehovah must be solid.
00:10:19 We need to be sensitive and receptive to the ways
00:10:22 in which he consoles and strengthens us.
00:10:25 We need to keep in mind what Paul says
00:10:28 at 2 Corinthians 1:4,
00:10:31 perhaps even memorizing it.
00:10:34 Jehovah is a God
00:10:36 “who comforts us in all our trials.”
00:10:43 Some time ago, we interviewed two longtime members
00:10:46 of the United States Bethel family:
00:10:49 Brother Gerald Grizzle,
00:10:51 a helper to the Personnel Committee,
00:10:53 and Brother Sam Roberson.
00:10:56 These two brothers served as traveling overseers
00:10:58 for many years prior to coming to Bethel.
00:11:01 Brother Grizzle has served at Bethel since 1978,
00:11:06 and Brother Roberson has served here for nearly 20 years.
00:11:10 They’ve been assigned by the Governing Body
00:11:13 to assist them in shepherding the United States Bethel family.
00:11:17 ‘Shepherding the Bethel family?’ you may ask.
00:11:20 ‘After all, Bethelites don’t have any distressing trials!’
00:11:24 Listen to what our dear brothers have to say.
00:11:28 Brother Grizzle, what are some of the challenges
00:11:31 that members of the Bethel family face?
00:11:34 The worldwide Bethel family
00:11:36 is a representation of the brotherhood.
00:11:41 By that I mean that
00:11:43 just as 1 Peter 5:9 says,
00:11:47 they face ‘the same kind of sufferings
00:11:50 ‘being experienced by the entire association
00:11:54 of our brothers in the world.’
00:11:56 Some deal with serious health problems,
00:12:00 but they continue to serve.
00:12:03 Others
00:12:05 have concerns over aging parents,
00:12:09 and some have to give up their beloved Bethel service.
00:12:15 Still others contend with bouts of depression.
00:12:19 But the spirit of these dear brothers and sisters
00:12:23 impels them to have the determination
00:12:28 not to allow these challenges to dominate them.
00:12:32 Rather, their faith in Jehovah
00:12:34 strengthens their resolve
00:12:37 to focus on their assignments.
00:12:40 Thank you for that insight,
00:12:41 Brother Grizzle.
00:12:43 Brother Roberson, how have you been able to comfort such ones?
00:12:48 When we find out a Bethelite
00:12:50 is going through a tragedy,
00:12:53 there are four things that we do.
00:12:55 Number one, we pray for them
00:12:58 and develop specific spiritual points
00:13:01 according to their needs.
00:13:04 And that’s before we make the call.
00:13:07 Number two, when we actually make the call,
00:13:10 we really listen.
00:13:11 And I don’t mean we just listen with our ears.
00:13:15 We try to listen with our hearts.
00:13:17 We try to feel what they feel.
00:13:20 We try to have compassion.
00:13:23 Number three, when we use God’s Word
00:13:28 to remind them they’re not facing their crisis alone,
00:13:31 this is very effective.
00:13:33 As an example, we called on a brother recently
00:13:36 who was going through a great trial,
00:13:39 and we shared, among other things,
00:13:41 Exodus 3:7, 12.
00:13:45 Let’s take a look at that:
00:13:47 “I have certainly seen the affliction
00:13:50 “of my people who are in Egypt,
00:13:52 “and I have heard their outcry
00:13:54 because of those who force them to work.”
00:13:57 And note the ending point here —it’s very beautiful.
00:14:02 Jehovah doesn’t say, ‘I know how my people feel’;
00:14:07 he says: “I well  know
00:14:09 the pains [of my people].”
00:14:12 And then in giving assurance
00:14:15 dealing with Moses fearing to go before Pharaoh,
00:14:18 in verse 12, just the A  part:
00:14:22 “To this he said: ‘I will prove to be with you.’”
00:14:28 It’s just a few words but so powerful,
00:14:31 where Jehovah is guaranteeing
00:14:34 that he’s going to give them undeniable proof
00:14:39 that he’s backing them up and never moving away from them one inch.
00:14:44 And this gives us comfort.
00:14:46 Now, number four,
00:14:48 before we conclude the call,
00:14:51 we have an ending prayer with them.
00:14:54 And we use their names,
00:14:56 and this is very comforting since we’re calling on Jehovah,
00:14:59 the Great Shepherd.
00:15:01 At 1 Thessalonians 5:14,
00:15:04 Paul says: “We urge you, brothers, to . . .
00:15:07 “speak consolingly to those who are depressed,
00:15:10 [to] support the weak, be patient toward all.”
00:15:14 And this is exactly what we’re trying to do.
00:15:17 Thanks for sharing those thoughts —very interesting.
00:15:21 Brothers Grizzle and Roberson:
00:15:24 How has comforting others affected you?
00:15:27 Brother Grizzle first, please.
00:15:29 During these challenging times,
00:15:32 I sense Jehovah’s love for his people.
00:15:36 Over the years,
00:15:38 I have seen and experienced his care
00:15:43 when facing difficult times.
00:15:46 Some years ago,
00:15:48 I lost my mother, my brother,
00:15:52 and my father in death all within a year.
00:15:57 And in 2017,
00:16:00 I lost my dear wife, Bonnie,
00:16:04 after we had served Jehovah together
00:16:07 for nearly 65 years.
00:16:10 But with much prayer,
00:16:12 research, and love of the friends,
00:16:16 Jehovah has comforted me.
00:16:19 And now, thankfully,
00:16:21 I have been able to offer encouragement to others.
00:16:24 Very touching, Brother Grizzle,
00:16:25 thank you.
00:16:28 Brother Roberson, how has comforting others
00:16:31 affected you?
00:16:33 One of the most memorable challenges
00:16:35 was while my wife, Linda, and I were in the circuit work
00:16:37 several years ago.
00:16:40 I lost my voice.
00:16:42 I had to have surgery on my vocal cords,
00:16:45 and for six weeks, I could not talk.
00:16:48 For a circuit overseer, that’s like being a bird without its wings.
00:16:53 I wrote more notes in that six weeks
00:16:57 than I had written in my whole life!
00:17:00 But in spite of that and along with other situations and tragedies
00:17:04 that we faced similar to Gerald’s,
00:17:07 Jehovah has seen us through them all.
00:17:10 And let me say, it’s been a real pleasure
00:17:12 to share Jehovah’s comfort with so many.
00:17:16 And as we do, we see the Governing Body’s interest
00:17:19 in all of Jehovah’s people,
00:17:21 including those with added responsibility.
00:17:24 They truly reflect Jehovah’s feelings
00:17:28 as “the God of all comfort.”
00:17:30 Well, thank you, brothers.
00:17:33 We really appreciate your comments.
00:17:35 And more than the shepherding that you do
00:17:39 is the example that you have set
00:17:42 in enduring trials,
00:17:44 in experiencing Jehovah’s comfort,
00:17:46 and in comforting others.
00:17:48 Thank you so much.
00:17:51 The Governing Body has instituted similar shepherding arrangements
00:17:55 in branch offices around the world.
00:18:00 Now we want to talk to some of you in our audience.
00:18:05 Because of stresses, disappointments,
00:18:09 and hurt feelings caused by fellow believers,
00:18:13 some have strayed from Jehovah’s organization.
00:18:17 Others may have been removed from the congregation
00:18:20 but now would like to return.
00:18:23 To you we say:
00:18:25 “Allow Jehovah to comfort and strengthen you.
00:18:29 He wants you to draw close to him, and he will help you.”
00:18:35 James 4:8 says:
00:18:38 “Draw close to God,
00:18:41 and he will draw close to you.”
00:18:45 Jehovah has great care for such ones.
00:18:49 Let’s read what he says
00:18:51 at Ezekiel 34:16:
00:18:56 “The stray I will bring back,
00:19:00 “the injured I will bandage,
00:19:03 and the weak I will strengthen.”
00:19:06 Some who have recovered have said
00:19:08 that one of the most difficult things for them to do
00:19:11 was to cross the threshold of the Kingdom Hall.
00:19:14 But remember, it’s Jehovah who bandages you,
00:19:19 his sheep, helping you to heal.
00:19:23 In the same chapter, in verse 12, he says:
00:19:27 “I will care for my sheep . . .
00:19:31 “I will rescue them from all the places
00:19:35 where they were scattered.”
00:19:38 In imitation of that love, the faithful slave says,
00:19:43 “We view you as lost sheep,
00:19:47 not a lost cause.”
00:19:50 To all we say,
00:19:52 “No matter what you face, remember:
00:19:55 “In difficult times,
00:19:57 Jehovah always comforts.”
00:20:03 Throughout our program, we’ll hear experiences
00:20:05 of brothers and sisters who were comforted by Jehovah.
00:20:10 As they share their stories,
00:20:12 look for all the ways Jehovah helped them
00:20:15 and consider how you can help others.
00:20:18 First is the experience of Maombi Vianney.
00:25:23 If you’re suffering some kind of trial
00:25:26 and you’re searching for God,
00:25:29 be encouraged by Maombi’s story.
00:25:32 Jehovah knows your struggles,
00:25:34 and he draws all deserving ones to him.
00:25:39 Did you notice that Maombi,
00:25:41 having received comfort,
00:25:43 was moved to help others?
00:25:45 In our next segment,
00:25:47 we’ll see just how powerful the love of our brothers and sisters can be.
00:26:09 LaQuita worked for the City of Virginia Beach.
00:26:12 With the city, she was able to get a schedule
00:26:16 that allowed her to focus on her ministry.
00:26:22 I came home on a Friday.
00:26:26 Both my mother and I had
00:26:27 doctors’ appointments that day.
00:26:30 And we came home and sat down,
00:26:32 getting ready to fix us a bite of lunch,
00:26:35 and I got a phone call.
00:26:37 It was a family member,
00:26:40 and they were asking me if I had seen the news.
00:26:44 I immediately
00:26:47 tried to call my daughter’s phone,
00:26:50 and it went straight to voice mail.
00:26:52 So I said, “Well, let me try texting her.”
00:26:56 So I tried texting her,
00:26:58 and I didn’t get any response.
00:27:02 It was about 10:00 or 10:30
00:27:07 that night when we just finally got the confirmation
00:27:10 that we had indeed lost her in that shooting.
00:27:18 And I will say, that was the worst day of my life.
00:27:24 The next day,
00:27:28 starting at seven o’clock in the morning,
00:27:31 friends started pouring in,
00:27:33 and we had
00:27:35 people in our home
00:27:39 to support us and encourage us
00:27:41 from morning till night.
00:27:50 And it meant so much.
00:27:54 It helped us to focus
00:27:58 on something else at that time.
00:28:01 The love that they showed to us —it was just astounding.
00:28:06 It was just so amazing.
00:28:08 And that’s what helped us to get through,
00:28:12 to get through it all
00:28:14 —it was our family, our spiritual family.
00:28:25 The City of Virginia Beach, they volunteered
00:28:29 to take care of all of the victims’ arrangements.
00:28:36 Because of the amount of people,
00:28:38 the venue that they decided upon
00:28:42 was the opera house in Norfolk.
00:28:45 The brothers, they got everything together.
00:28:48 The city didn’t really have to do anything; they just gave us the venue.
00:28:53 And what really impressed them,
00:28:55 the city, was that
00:28:58 the whole memorial, everything,
00:29:03 took place within an hour.
00:29:05 The city officials were there in attendance.
00:29:08 You had the local newspapers
00:29:10 who covered it, reporters.
00:29:13 The reporters
00:29:15 were persistent in wanting to talk,
00:29:19 and so actually two of my brothers,
00:29:23 they handled all of that information,
00:29:25 with the guidance from those two brothers who came down.
00:29:29 It kept us from having to even worry about that, you know,
00:29:33 so it was very helpful.
00:29:36 I continue to get cards;
00:29:38 I get texts from people,
00:29:42 and it just encourages me.
00:29:46 Isaiah 41:10
00:29:50 —that has become my favorite scripture.
00:29:53 “I will really hold on to you
00:29:55 with my right hand of righteousness.”
00:29:59 Going through this,
00:30:01 I could really feel Jehovah’s hand.
00:30:04 It’s as if he was rubbing my shoulders
00:30:09 and saying: ‘It’s going to be all right.
00:30:13 ‘You’ll be all right.
00:30:15 I’m going to get you through this.’
00:30:17 And he has.
00:30:21 Each day he gets me through this.
00:30:24 If it can happen to someone else, it can happen to me.
00:30:28 And in this instance, it did.
00:30:30 But
00:30:32 that helps me to keep a perspective,
00:30:36 and I reflect on how Jehovah
00:30:40 is going to reverse it.
00:30:42 That’s my biggest hope
00:30:46 —to see Jehovah reverse
00:30:49 the damage that has been done.
00:30:51 He’s promised it, and my faith
00:30:55 is in the fulfillment of his promises.
00:30:58 So I look forward to being reunited with my daughter.
00:31:05 Isaiah 43:2 says, in part:
00:31:09 “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,
00:31:13 and through the rivers, they will not flood over you.”
00:31:19 Tragic and unforeseen things
00:31:21 can befall faithful servants of Jehovah.
00:31:24 We may suffer terribly, but we are not destroyed.
00:31:29 We will always belong to Jehovah,
00:31:33 “the Father of tender mercies.”
00:31:35 Jehovah is always there for us,
00:31:38 but we all lead such busy lives.
00:31:41 Our new music video vividly shows the blessings we receive
00:31:45 when we make time for Jehovah.
00:31:53 So much to do And so few hours in our day,
00:32:01 It’s hard to steal away moments to pray.
00:32:09 But we have got to find a way to . . .
00:32:18 Make time for Jehovah. Make him part of your life.
00:32:29 Don’t let life in this world draw you away.
00:32:39 Make time for Jehovah.
00:32:46 Friends grow close When words from the heart are shared.
00:32:56 But how can we share and see that he cares?
00:33:03 How will we know that he’s there Unless we . . .
00:33:12 Make time for Jehovah. Make him part of your life.
00:33:24 Don’t let life in this world draw you away.
00:33:32 Make time for Jehovah.
00:33:42 Make time To see his hand in our life.
00:33:48 Make time To see ourselves in Paradise.
00:33:58 Let nothing get in our way.
00:34:09 Make time.
00:34:12 Make time.
00:34:15 Make the time.
00:34:20 Make time for Jehovah. Make him part of your life.
00:34:33 Don’t let life in this world draw you away.
00:34:42 Make time for Jehovah.
00:34:54 Make time.
00:35:06 Make time.
00:35:18 Make time.
00:35:30 Make time.
00:35:36 Make time.
00:35:42 Make time.
00:35:48 Make time.
00:35:52 Make time.
00:36:04 “Make time to see his hand in our life.”
00:36:08 What a beautiful expression!
00:36:12 Are you your harshest critic?
00:36:15 We can be discouraged by our own shortcomings or failures
00:36:18 —real or imagined.
00:36:21 Notice what can help in the latest episode of our series
00:36:25 “Apply Bible Principles.”
00:36:36 When I was growing up, my parents always used to say:
00:36:40 “Pray about your spiritual goals.
00:36:45 “Work hard.
00:36:49 And then let Jehovah do the rest.”
00:36:57 So that’s what I did.
00:37:01 And wow, did Jehovah pour out the blessings!
00:37:07 I even got invited to a branch construction project.
00:37:11 And I was pretty excited
00:37:14 at first.
00:37:18 Don’t get me wrong.
00:37:19 It was a privilege to be there,
00:37:22 but the work was harder than I thought it would be.
00:37:29 There were a lot of new skills to learn.
00:37:34 And I have to admit, I really wanted to impress my overseer.
00:37:40 So I pushed hard,
00:37:46 maybe a little too hard.
00:37:51 Do you see all that up there?
00:37:53 That all needs to come down.
00:37:55 OK.
00:37:55 Do you think you can wrap this up before tomorrow?
00:37:57 Sure thing. I’m on it.
00:38:00 You can grab Jin and Young to give you a hand with the lift.
00:38:03 Jin’s a pro; he’ll help you out.
00:38:05 Got it.
00:38:07 The job didn’t look that hard.
00:38:10 And, I mean, I had the training.
00:38:13 So if I had waited for them,
00:38:16 there was no way we were going to get this done today.
00:38:56 The fact is, I had caused some real damage,
00:39:01 and I made more work for everyone.
00:39:06 Ian, are you OK?
00:39:08 Yes, I’m fine.
00:39:10 Do you have a minute to talk in my office?
00:39:12 Yeah.
00:39:19 I felt like such a loser.
00:39:30 The brothers talked to me, and they were nice about it.
00:39:33 But I was still left thinking:
00:39:35 ‘What am I doing here?
00:39:37 Maybe I should just go home.’
00:39:40 James 3:2 says:
00:39:42 “For we all stumble many times.”
00:39:46 But the real question is,
00:39:48 When we stumble —and it is going to happen—
00:39:52 what should we do then?
00:39:56 Yes, Jake.
00:40:00 Well, when Dad was teaching me to ride my bike,
00:40:03 I fell a lot.
00:40:05 And it was hard.
00:40:06 But I just kept getting up and trying again.
00:40:10 And now I can ride pretty fast!
00:40:14 So you just have to get back up when you fall.
00:40:17 Yes, that’s right! That was a great comment.
00:40:21 Wow, Jake, that’s it!
00:40:24 I had to swallow my pride and just get back up.
00:40:35 I realized I needed to be more focused
00:40:37 on the seriousness of my assignment and not so focused on myself.
00:40:44 And instead of trying to do everything myself,
00:40:47 I set more realistic expectations
00:40:50 about what I could do and what I couldn’t.
00:40:56 I had a lot to learn.
00:40:59 So I kept working and learning.
00:41:04 And after a while,
00:41:07 I even got to help train some of the new volunteers.
00:41:13 In the end, I was so thankful to Jehovah
00:41:16 for helping me understand that in the race for life,
00:41:20 none of us are going to cross the finish line without stumbling.
00:41:24 The important thing is to get back up and just keep going.
00:41:32 Some hesitate to draw close to people
00:41:35 of different races or nationalities.
00:41:38 But they can overcome this by imitating Jehovah’s impartiality.
00:41:42 The result?
00:41:43 Great joy.
00:41:45 We’ll see an example of this in the following report.
00:41:55 On September 18, 2020,
00:41:58 Medicane Ianos,
00:41:59 a rare Mediterranean cyclone, struck Greece
00:42:03 and flooded a Roma settlement in Mavrika,
00:42:05 just outside the city of Karditsa.
00:42:11 Local authorities worked alongside emergency services to evacuate
00:42:14 over 1,000 Roma who lived there.
00:42:17 But a family of seven
00:42:18 who are studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:42:20 were left behind.
00:42:24 It was raining hard,
00:42:25 and the floodwaters were rising quickly.
00:42:28 I took my wife by the hand
00:42:29 and carried my child on my back.
00:42:32 With great difficulty, we managed to make it to a neighboring house.
00:42:36 We were unable to contact the authorities.
00:42:39 We were terrified and had no option but to stay there.
00:42:42 We didn’t know what to do.
00:42:45 We were so scared and worried.
00:42:47 We had never experienced
00:42:49 anything like this before.
00:42:51 The floodwaters had risen a lot,
00:42:53 and we stood waiting for hours.
00:42:56 I asked my father to pray for us.
00:42:59 He did many times.
00:43:02 There were lots of people in the house, both young and old.
00:43:06 They were afraid, and they were crying.
00:43:14 Video messages from the family started to come through, asking for help.
00:43:19 We could see their fear.
00:43:21 We wanted to help them,
00:43:23 but there was no way for us to go there because access was impossible.
00:43:28 All we could do was pray to Jehovah for them
00:43:31 and send messages of encouragement.
00:43:34 We were very distressed.
00:43:36 Children were crying.
00:43:38 I prayed to Jehovah, begging him for peace of mind.
00:43:42 I threw all of my burdens and anxiety of my heart on Jehovah.
00:43:46 Soon, I felt calm and had no anxiety.
00:43:51 I felt his spirit giving me strength during the hours that followed until dawn.
00:44:12 The situation was very difficult.
00:44:14 They had suffered a lot,
00:44:16 and their clothes were dirty.
00:44:18 There was no way
00:44:19 that I could leave them there.
00:44:23 We were given a house to stay in.
00:44:26 We were able to calm down and sleep.
00:44:29 The brothers gave us food.
00:44:31 I thanked Jehovah for teaching us and taking care of us.
00:44:36 He is our Savior.
00:44:40 When I attended the first meeting after the flood, I felt calm again.
00:44:45 I tried to keep my routine as normal:
00:44:49 study, meetings, preparing comments.
00:44:53 I felt joy and contentment.
00:44:56 My legal documents, such as my ID, were saved from the flood.
00:45:01 Our neighbors were not prepared.
00:45:04 But we, thanks to Jehovah’s direction,
00:45:06 had packed emergency bags.
00:45:09 About a week later, we were able to return to Mavrika.
00:45:13 The houses were in terrible condition, full of mud.
00:45:18 The Disaster Relief Committee helped us immediately.
00:45:22 Brothers from 300 kilometers (190 mi) away sent emergency supplies.
00:45:27 The brotherhood showed us love in practice.
00:45:31 They worked hard and helped us because they love us.
00:45:34 I was deeply touched and found myself in awe.
00:45:37 We are united.
00:45:39 All of this brought glory and praise to Jehovah.
00:45:44 When we went there to help, the Roma neighbors were very surprised.
00:45:48 They asked if we could help them too.
00:45:51 We replied that we have to help our family first, our brothers.
00:45:56 They were very puzzled that we called our Roma brothers family
00:45:59 since we were not from their tribe.
00:46:04 Ephesians 4:16 finds a good application in this story.
00:46:08 Just as every joint in the body offers help,
00:46:13 so did the brothers.
00:46:16 We all worked together
00:46:18 to provide help to our brothers in need.
00:46:23 Jehovah is teaching me and helping me.
00:46:26 I really trust in him.
00:46:28 He has blessed me personally.
00:46:30 I have seen how good he is to me.
00:46:33 In a miserable world, Jehovah brings me joy.
00:46:37 I know that he chooses according to a person’s heart.
00:46:41 All glory belongs to Jehovah!
00:46:48 In total,
00:46:50 seven members of the Tsakiris family are studying the Bible.
00:46:53 Five, who are deaf,
00:46:55 are studying with a Greek Sign Language group.
00:46:59 When the flood struck,
00:47:01 about 20 people, including the Tsakiris family,
00:47:05 could not be evacuated because of strong currents.
00:47:08 At first, other Roma who had been left behind blamed the flood on the family
00:47:13 because they were all studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:47:16 But after they observed the assistance provided by the brothers and sisters,
00:47:21 they said: “You have the true religion.
00:47:25 You show genuine love.”
00:47:29 Our series “My Teen Life”
00:47:32 has helped many young Witnesses
00:47:34 navigate today’s realities.
00:47:37 Our next episode has to do with association,
00:47:42 and we’ll hear from a brother and a sister
00:47:44 who eventually made good decisions
00:47:46 with the help of Bible principles.
00:47:49 That may not surprise you.
00:47:51 But what we’re looking for in this is “how.”
00:47:55 How did they go from knowing Bible principles to applying them?
00:48:11 My parents were both Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:48:13 by the time I was born.
00:48:14 So I studied the Bible,
00:48:16 attended meetings, and went out in service with them.
00:48:21 Growing up in the truth, I knew
00:48:23 that living by Bible standards is what’s best for me.
00:48:26 And my parents were always so zealous
00:48:28 when it came to spiritual things.
00:48:31 So when I think back,
00:48:33 I just didn’t want to let them down.
00:48:36 Following Bible principles is not burdensome
00:48:39 or even that difficult.
00:48:42 Honestly, if we do as it says in the Bible, then we benefit ourselves.
00:48:47 But at times, I was curious
00:48:49 how my life would be if I wasn’t in the truth.
00:48:52 It was just so fun to be around my school friends.
00:48:56 Overall, I had a good time at school.
00:49:00 I got along with my classmates,  and my teachers liked me too.
00:49:03 So being in school was a pretty good experience.
00:49:07 My parents always told me not to get too close to my classmates,
00:49:12 but in my opinion, my friends
00:49:14 had good conduct and were good people.
00:49:17 I didn’t understand why they were so worried.
00:49:20 In my high school,
00:49:22 there were a lot of kids who went to church
00:49:24 and many of the teachers had religious backgrounds.
00:49:27 One day, there was an incident when the entire school found out
00:49:31 I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:49:34 I knew that some people might be prejudiced
00:49:36 against Witnesses, but I was surprised
00:49:39 to see how everyone could change so suddenly.
00:49:42 I started spending more time with my classmates,
00:49:45 but the more I hung out with them, the more I saw
00:49:48 that we were living completely different lives.
00:49:51 Their conversations would be about trips they went on over the weekend
00:49:54 and what they bought on their latest shopping trip,
00:49:57 but when it came to me, all I had done was spiritual activities.
00:50:00 It felt like I was missing out.
00:50:03 I felt alone and like an outcast.
00:50:07 I knew in my head that Bible principles are right and beneficial,
00:50:11 but when I was actually put in that situation,
00:50:14 I wasn’t so sure anymore.
00:50:18 I started to feel like I wasn’t as cool as my classmates,
00:50:22 so when they started to talk about their life goals,
00:50:24 I couldn’t bring myself to tell them what my goals were.
00:50:28 So I started thinking,
00:50:31 ‘What would be the right way for me to act?’
00:50:34 Opening up to my parents about my situation really helped.
00:50:38 One day for family worship, we decided
00:50:41 to discuss that topic.
00:50:44 We read Matthew 5:11:
00:50:46 “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you
00:50:50 “and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing
00:50:52 against you for my sake.”
00:50:55 But how can you be happy when persecuted?
00:50:59 I thought to myself, ‘But I’m not happy right now.’
00:51:02 My mom shared Mark 8:38 with me.
00:51:05 The part in the scripture where it says
00:51:07 that if we are ashamed of Jesus Christ,
00:51:09 he will be ashamed of us
00:51:11 really hit me.
00:51:13 I realized that deep inside
00:51:15 I had been ashamed of being a Witness.
00:51:18 While I was going through all of this,
00:51:19 a brother gave a public talk in our congregation
00:51:23 and read Matthew 19:29.
00:51:26 There it says that everyone who has left
00:51:28 what is important to them “for the sake of [Jehovah]
00:51:31 will receive a hundred times as much.”
00:51:34 So I decided to try leaving what I thought was important to me
00:51:39 and seeing what results and blessings I might receive.
00:51:42 About that time,
00:51:44 my parents helped me to associate with brothers and sisters
00:51:47 who were participating in many different forms of full-time service
00:51:51 so that I could hear their experiences.
00:51:53 That helped me to decide
00:51:55 which direction I wanted to go in my life.
00:51:58 One thing that was really great about this decision
00:52:02 was that I was able to meet many new brothers and sisters.
00:52:05 I realized that there were so many people
00:52:08 who had the same thoughts and goals as I did.
00:52:11 These were my true friends.
00:52:14 The next time the topic of our future goals came up with my classmates,
00:52:17 I was able to speak up confidently.
00:52:20 I am really thankful to my parents
00:52:22 who helped me to find the courage to do that.
00:52:24 I’ve felt that Jehovah truly keeps his promises.
00:52:29 Come to think of it,
00:52:31 Jehovah has kept his promise to reward me
00:52:33 a hundred times as much
00:52:35 if I choose to live by the Bible’s principles.
00:52:41 I am really happy now,
00:52:43 and I am confident that if I follow the Bible’s teachings when I make decisions,
00:52:47 I will always have the best results.
00:53:04 They were familiar with the Bible.
00:53:07 But its value became real to them
00:53:10 when they put Bible principles into practice.
00:53:15 This month’s program underscored that in difficult times,
00:53:20 Jehovah always comforts.
00:53:23 Servants of Jehovah like Sister Brown and her daughter
00:53:27 may suffer terrible blows.
00:53:31 But no matter what happens to us, even “if we die,
00:53:35 we [always] belong to Jehovah.”
00:53:38 Bible truths were a comfort to Maombi,
00:53:40  who never gave up searching for God.
00:53:44 And finally, all of us provide comfort
00:53:48 when we show impartial love.
00:53:52 Now it’s time for our video postcard.
00:53:55 This month we visit our brothers in Alaska.
00:54:01 Alaska is in the far northwest corner of North America.
00:54:06 One third of it lies within the Arctic Circle.
00:54:08 In some areas, temperatures can drop
00:54:11 below negative 60 degrees Fahrenheit,
00:54:14 or negative 54 degrees Celsius.
00:54:17 This is a sparsely populated land of glaciers,
00:54:21 permafrost, and tundra
00:54:23 and is a rich habitat
00:54:25 for bears, caribou,
00:54:27 moose, whales, and dozens of species of fish.
00:54:31 Let’s visit the Kuskokwim Congregation in Bethel, Alaska.
00:54:36 That’s right —the village is named Bethel!
00:54:38 Twenty-two publishers preach in a territory that includes
00:54:41 13 villages connected by waterways.
00:54:45 As the weather and seasons change,
00:54:48 so does their choice of transportation.
00:54:51 Four-wheelers and snowmobiles are common
00:54:53 since many villages lack roads and cars.
00:54:57 This “road” is actually on top of a frozen river.
00:55:01 Here’s a caravan of publishers
00:55:03 on their way to the village of Kwethluk.
00:55:06 To be safe, brothers travel with two or more vehicles
00:55:10 in case one gets stuck or breaks down.
00:55:13 Daily sunlight varies with the seasons
00:55:16 from less than 6 hours during winter
00:55:18 to more than 19 during summer.
00:55:22 The congregation includes
00:55:24 nine regular and five special pioneers.
00:55:28 An average of 85 Bible studies
00:55:30 are conducted every month.
00:55:33 In addition to an English congregation,
00:55:35 there is a Yupik pregroup.
00:55:38 Dog sledding is an important part of Yupik culture.
00:55:41 Several races are held here every year.
00:55:45 This Bible student is wearing
00:55:47 a traditional garment called a qaspeq.
00:55:49 Many at the meetings give their comments in Yupik
00:55:53 and have them translated into English.
00:55:55 Although most publishers aren’t fluent in Yupik,
00:55:59 they use publications and videos
00:56:01 translated into Yupik in the ministry.
00:56:04 Baptisms are normally held
00:56:06 at conventions and assemblies in the city of Anchorage.
00:56:09 But this Bible student made her dedication to Jehovah
00:56:12 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:56:14 Despite the frigid weather,
00:56:17 she was baptized in this river.
00:56:19 This is where she grew up.
00:56:21 Our brothers and sisters from the Kuskokwim Congregation
00:56:24 in Bethel, Alaska
00:56:26 send their love and greetings
00:56:28 to the worldwide brotherhood!
00:56:31 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:56:34 this is JW Broadcasting.
