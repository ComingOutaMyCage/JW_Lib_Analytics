00:00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®
00:00:04 for February 2022!
00:00:26 Last month,
00:00:27 we enjoyed Part 1
00:00:29 of the 2021 annual meeting.
00:00:31 That program was filled
00:00:33 with exciting announcements,
00:00:36 videos, and stirring talks
00:00:38 delivered by several members of the Governing Body.
00:00:42 And it was so heartwarming to see
00:00:44 a live audience of Bethel family members
00:00:48 come together to enjoy this spiritual feast.
00:00:52 Well, this month, we’re happy to present the second half
00:00:56 of the annual meeting program.
00:00:58 We know you’re going to thoroughly enjoy
00:01:01 the encouraging updates, interviews, and talks to follow.
00:01:06 Well, we know that the pandemic has altered all of our lives,
00:01:11 and we commend all in the worldwide brotherhood
00:01:14 for your loyal response to direction.
00:01:18 As you likely know,
00:01:20 more specific direction and restrictions were recommended
00:01:24 for those who serve as special full-time servants in the field.
00:01:28 Let’s hear now from some of them
00:01:31 about the unique circumstances they experienced.
00:01:38 Jehovah provides
00:01:39 all of the things that we need
00:01:41 to accomplish our ministry
00:01:42 and to feel secure
00:01:44 no matter what tribulation we face.
00:01:47 We truly have experienced Jehovah’s loving support
00:01:51 during this pandemic.
00:01:53 Our heavenly Father, through his organization,
00:01:56 has provided just what we’ve needed
00:01:58 to endure faithfully in our ministry
00:02:00 and to stay strong spiritually.
00:02:03 How has the direction
00:02:05 to shelter in place affected circuit overseers,
00:02:08 construction servants, field missionaries,
00:02:12 and special pioneers?
00:02:14 How have they been able to continue in their ministry
00:02:17 serving Jehovah whole-souled and with joy?
00:02:21 What practical lessons have they learned?
00:02:25 To follow the Governing Body’s direction
00:02:28 to shelter in place,
00:02:29 we couldn’t go in to see Steve’s mother.
00:02:32 She was in aged care just ten minutes away
00:02:36 from where we’re based.
00:02:38 She died while we were sheltering in place.
00:02:41 This led to another challenge
00:02:43 —grieving in isolation.
00:02:47 At the beginning
00:02:48 of the shelter-in-place direction,
00:02:50 I had a very difficult time.
00:02:53 I had flashbacks
00:02:56 that were very difficult for me.
00:02:59 During the Vietnam War,
00:03:02 I was imprisoned because of taking a neutral stand.
00:03:07 I had a reaction to this lockdown
00:03:11 of being confined.
00:03:35 We especially discerned
00:03:37 the value of the direction in November 2020
00:03:40 when, suddenly,
00:03:41 I was taken to the hospital because of a serious heart disease
00:03:45 and severe pneumonia.
00:03:47 It turned out that my life was in danger.
00:03:51 The doctors evaluated that if I had contracted the coronavirus
00:03:55 in that condition,
00:03:57 I would not have had a chance to survive it.
00:04:00 While sheltering in place,
00:04:02 how did these obedient brothers and sisters stay positive
00:04:06 and maintain their physical, emotional, and spiritual health?
00:04:10 Even through that difficult time,
00:04:14 having Zoom  meetings,
00:04:16 having the meetings for field service,
00:04:19 doing witnessing by Zoom,
00:04:21 and being with the brothers and sisters
00:04:23 —I can’t say enough good about it.
00:04:26 In being able not to meet an hour requirement
00:04:30 but by going ahead and being very busy spiritually,
00:04:34 we did a phenomenal amount of shepherding,
00:04:37 strengthening, and upbuilding our brothers and sisters
00:04:41 —folks literally from around the world that we knew needed help.
00:04:44 When the Governing Body removed the specific hour requirement,
00:04:51 I think we felt their trust.
00:04:56 That gave us more flexibility,
00:04:59 and this enabled us to reach out
00:05:01 to relatives not in the truth
00:05:04 and to support them during the pandemic.
00:05:07 And that has led
00:05:09 to two, regular, continuing Bible studies.
00:05:14 I really feel how much
00:05:16 the Governing Body cares for us
00:05:19 every time they mention in their letters
00:05:21 that they do not require us to reach the required hours.
00:05:25 Many brothers and sisters today are depressed
00:05:29 and experiencing pandemic fatigue.
00:05:31 Usually they need someone
00:05:33 who they can talk to about their problems.
00:05:36 And because of these adjustments,
00:05:38 I now have more time to encourage them
00:05:40 and help them to remain spiritually strong.
00:06:11 Since most congregations I serve
00:06:13 don’t have Internet access,
00:06:15 I make video recordings for all the talks.
00:06:20 I make a simple platform and set up the microphone and cell phone
00:06:24 that I use to create the video.
00:06:26 Then I stand in front and start giving the talk.
00:06:31 What blessings did they receive from their obedience?
00:06:35 I was so happy to start a Bible study during the pandemic,
00:06:40 especially when I saw how quickly the student was making progress.
00:06:44 Because of my health,
00:06:46 each study session was about 15 to 20 minutes long.
00:06:50 I had to find a good place to conduct the study at the hospital,
00:06:54 mainly in the hallway.
00:06:56 One day after the concluding prayer,
00:06:58 I noticed the door to a doctor’s office was open.
00:07:02 The doctor was listening to our whole Bible study discussion.
00:07:06 I was so happy she attended the study as well.
00:07:38 Recently, in my circuit,
00:07:40 59 Bible students progressed to baptism.
00:07:45 Unity within families is another blessing.
00:07:48 Parents are spending a lot of time
00:07:51 conducting Bible studies with their children.
00:07:57 Our Christian life is compared to a race,
00:08:01 and this is not a short race.
00:08:03 There are unexpected things that can happen to us.
00:08:09 By striving to obey from the heart now,
00:08:13 we can be prepared to obey the directions
00:08:16 that we are going to receive in the great tribulation.
00:08:22 We are sure that this is not the last time
00:08:25 that we have to be obedient.
00:08:27 We see Bible prophecies being fulfilled
00:08:29 right in front of our eyes, and ahead of us are
00:08:32 even greater events that will bring larger trials.
00:08:36 James 1:2, 3 helps us despite trials to keep joy
00:08:41 —deep joy— in our hearts,
00:08:44 and it assures us that all difficult situations
00:08:46 will help us to work on endurance.
00:08:49 And this quality will help us to cope with trials to come.
00:08:55 I personally have benefited from following
00:08:57 the Governing Body’s direction.
00:09:00 I’ve actually felt joy every day,
00:09:04 and I can only put that down to the blessing from Jehovah God
00:09:09 on our efforts to be obedient.
00:09:12 We’ve both benefited from the direction from the Governing Body
00:09:17 because we trust
00:09:19 that they are “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:09:21 Christ Jesus is directing them.
00:09:23 I am so absolutely grateful
00:09:27 to the Governing Body for providing direction
00:09:32 that is blessing every single one of us around the earth.
00:09:37 Just like you,
00:09:39 these dear ones have made great sacrifices
00:09:42 to continue serving Jehovah whole-souled during this pandemic,
00:09:47 and no doubt we’ve all learned the value
00:09:49 of applying the words at 2 Timothy 4:2:
00:09:53 “Preach the word; be at it urgently
00:09:57 in favorable times and difficult times.”
00:10:00 For a certainty, neither this pandemic
00:10:04 nor any other difficult times to come
00:10:06 will stop our preaching work
00:10:09 and, more importantly, prevent
00:10:12 Jehovah’s loving care.
00:10:23 We certainly express our love and appreciation
00:10:26 to all of our special full-time servants in the field
00:10:28 for the excellent example they’ve set in following direction.
00:10:33 Well, as a very appropriate follow-up
00:10:36 to the two preceding video presentations,
00:10:38 we’re happy now to have our very dear Brother Gerrit Lösch,
00:10:42 a member of the Governing Body,
00:10:44 provide comfort for all of us
00:10:48 with his talk entitled
00:10:50 “No Resident Will Say: ‘I Am Sick.’”
00:10:55 Aren’t we all glad that we are healthy enough
00:10:58 to be able to listen to the annual meeting program?
00:11:02 Yes, we don’t want to take it for granted.
00:11:06 Worldwide, some 20,000 of our brothers and sisters
00:11:10 have died so far from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:11:16 But tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters,
00:11:18 including many relatives,
00:11:20 have been and are now affected emotionally by this fact.
00:11:26 Death tolls affect friends and family,
00:11:29 and the feeling of loss is deep.
00:11:33 Secular sources say that the overall death rate in the United States
00:11:37 is about 1 percent of the population each year.
00:11:42 Every year around the world,
00:11:44 an average of over 60 million people die.
00:11:49 The daily average is about 164,000.
00:11:54 How sad!
00:11:57 With the COVID-19 plague,
00:12:00 the number of total deaths worldwide is, of course, higher.
00:12:04 In the United States, over 600,000 citizens
00:12:09 have died from COVID-19 alone.
00:12:13 Even when tempered by the hope of the resurrection,
00:12:17 the death of a loved one is still a traumatic loss
00:12:21 which is deeply felt.
00:12:24 Years, perhaps decades, of close companionship and sharing
00:12:29 are suddenly and tragically ended.
00:12:34 Of course, if those that died were part of our family,
00:12:38 it affects us much more emotionally.
00:12:43 We are also affected because we did not expect them to die,
00:12:47 except perhaps if some were in their 80’s or 90’s.
00:12:52 Even though we know that they will come back,
00:12:55 we still feel hurt and are very sorry
00:12:59 to have temporarily lost them.
00:13:03 It is very sad to lose somebody in death,
00:13:06 even temporarily, isn’t it?
00:13:11 In the case of Lazarus,
00:13:13 the Bible shows that even Jesus shed tears
00:13:17 when he saw the emotional pain
00:13:19 experienced by Lazarus’ sisters.
00:13:23 To be sad and to cry in the case of somebody’s death
00:13:27 is not an indication of somebody’s lack of faith
00:13:30 or an emotional imbalance.
00:13:34 Never feel ashamed in such a case.
00:13:38 Feel free to “[give] way to tears.”
00:13:44 At John 5:28, 29,
00:13:49 Jesus’ promise is comforting.
00:13:53 He said:
00:13:54 “Do not be amazed at this,
00:13:56 “[because] the hour is coming
00:13:58 “in which all those in the memorial tombs
00:14:01 “will hear [the Son of God’s] voice
00:14:03 “and come out, those who did good things
00:14:07 “to a resurrection of life,
00:14:09 “and those who practiced vile things
00:14:11 to a resurrection of judgment.”
00:14:14 However, Jehovah foretold that sickness and death
00:14:18 will not continue forever
00:14:21 but are temporary now
00:14:23 and will soon end as the new world arrives.
00:14:27 Even in the past, Jehovah miraculously proved
00:14:31 that he’s able to prevent sickness and subsequent death.
00:14:35 And he proved that he has the power
00:14:38 to bring back humans to life.
00:14:42 As much as we are sorry to have lost relatives
00:14:45 or friends in death
00:14:48 because of COVID-19 or any other reason,
00:14:51 we can rejoice that Jehovah will bring them back in the resurrection.
00:14:57 Jehovah brought back some of his servants
00:15:00 in the resurrection in the past.
00:15:03 The Bible speaks of nine specific resurrections of individuals.
00:15:09 Instead of reading a list with their names,
00:15:12 you can try to recall who these persons were.
00:15:16 If you don’t come up with nine persons,
00:15:19 why not make it a part of a conversation with friends to complete the list?
00:15:25 It refers to Jesus and eight additional ones.
00:15:30 It is so encouraging and comforting to talk about it.
00:15:36 Hebrews 11:35 speaks of a better resurrection,
00:15:42 better than the resurrection of the eight persons mentioned in the Bible
00:15:47 who had to die again at a later date.
00:15:51 The future resurrection is better
00:15:54 because it contains the possibility
00:15:57 to never die again in all eternity.
00:16:02 Imagine living not only for a thousand years
00:16:06 but for a million years,
00:16:08 for ten million years, for a hundred million years,
00:16:12 for a hundred billion years, and so on.
00:16:17 As for those being brought back in the resurrection,
00:16:20 the resurrection will be perceived like having happened
00:16:24 in the blink of an eye after their death,
00:16:27 although they may have been dead for quite some time.
00:16:32 For instance, when Lazarus was resurrected,
00:16:35 he did not recall that he was laying in the tomb.
00:16:40 When he was resurrected,
00:16:42 to him it was like the next moment
00:16:44 after he lost consciousness from dying.
00:16:49 When he came to,
00:16:51 he had no perception that he was in the tomb.
00:16:54 Jehovah created man originally.
00:16:58 He can also re-create a human.
00:17:02 Psalm 104:29, 30 says:
00:17:08 “When you hide your face,
00:17:10 “they are disturbed.
00:17:12 “If you take away their spirit,
00:17:14 “they die and return to the dust.
00:17:17 “If you send out the spirit,
00:17:19 they are created.”
00:17:21 Jehovah will give the resurrected ones a body
00:17:24 just as it pleases him.
00:17:27 Their bodies will be physically sound
00:17:29 and obviously look similar to the original body
00:17:33 so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.
00:17:38 Faithful Christians who die late during the time of the end
00:17:42 will likely be among the first ones to be raised again.
00:17:47 We can also expect an early resurrection
00:17:50 for some of the faithful men of old
00:17:52 who will join others as “princes” in the new world.
00:17:58 Nevertheless, we should not be dogmatic on such matters.
00:18:03 On many issues related to the resurrection,
00:18:06 the Bible is silent.
00:18:08 It does not spell out details of how,
00:18:11 when, or at what locations
00:18:13 the resurrection of individuals will occur.
00:18:17 It does not tell us how those returning
00:18:20 will be housed, fed, and clothed.
00:18:24 It would be unwise to spend a lot of time
00:18:27 trying to find answers that are at present unanswerable.
00:18:32 It is best to just focus
00:18:35 on the fact of the resurrection to come.
00:18:39 First Corinthians 15:52
00:18:43 also speaks of the resurrection
00:18:45 —not of an earthly resurrection,
00:18:48 but a heavenly, spiritual one.
00:18:52 This text refers to anointed ones
00:18:55 who would die and be raised “in the blink of an eye.”
00:19:00 This resurrection began during our time, the time of the end.
00:19:05 When they die, they go to heaven in an instant
00:19:09 —like during “the blink of an eye.”
00:19:13 But those who have the earthly hope to live forever on earth in Paradise
00:19:18 also will have the same perception later
00:19:21 when they will be resurrected in the Paradise.
00:19:26 The time from their death to the moment of their resurrection
00:19:30 will not be consciously experienced by them.
00:19:34 It will be for them like the ‘blinking of an eye.’
00:19:40 Those resurrected to heaven
00:19:42 will obtain immortality.
00:19:45 Those resurrected on earth will not be immortal
00:19:49 but have the chance to live forever as long as they remain faithful.
00:19:56 In connection with the ancient Israelites,
00:20:00 Jehovah also proved that he’s able to protect
00:20:03 his people from sicknesses.
00:20:05 And he did it when the Israelites remained faithful.
00:20:10 Deuteronomy 7:15 foretold
00:20:13 in connection with those who escaped from Egypt:
00:20:17 “Jehovah will take away from you all sickness,
00:20:21 “and he will not bring upon you
00:20:24 any of the terrible diseases that you have known in Egypt.”
00:20:30 We can trust that Jehovah fulfilled his promise.
00:20:33 He did so when the Israelites were faithful.
00:20:37 He blessed the Israelites with good health and long life.
00:20:42 This shows his past love for the people of Israel.
00:20:47 It also indicates his power
00:20:49 and that if he wishes to repeat this miracle,
00:20:53 he can do it, of course.
00:20:57 He will do so after Armageddon,
00:21:00 during the Millennium, or Thousand Year Reign of Christ.
00:21:05 Revelation 22:2 foretells
00:21:09 “the healing of the nations.”
00:21:11 This includes physical and emotional healing in the new world.
00:21:18 Death is really an enemy,
00:21:20 but Jehovah will do away with it.
00:21:24 At Isaiah 33:24, it says
00:21:27 that in the new world
00:21:30 “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”
00:21:36 There will be no hospitals.
00:21:38 There will be no drugstores.
00:21:40 There will be no physicians.
00:21:43 There will be no professional nurses.
00:21:47 At Revelation 21:4, it foretells that in the new world
00:21:51 there will be ‘neither mourning nor outcry nor pain anymore.’
00:21:58 We are very sad about what happened around the world
00:22:01 with so many of our brothers and sisters
00:22:03 falling asleep from COVID-19 recently,
00:22:06 but we know they will come back.
00:22:10 They will come back healthy.
00:22:13 They will not come back looking like old people,
00:22:17 even if they died at 80 years.
00:22:20 They might look like they are in their 30’s when resurrected.
00:22:25 As stated earlier,
00:22:27 they will look reasonably similar to their original body
00:22:31 so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.
00:22:37 How it fills our hearts with love for Jehovah
00:22:40 that he will bring back in the resurrection our loved ones!
00:22:46 The apostle Paul had a firm hope.
00:22:49 He explained at 2 Corinthians 1:7:
00:22:54 “Our hope for you is unwavering,
00:22:58 “knowing as we do that,
00:23:01 “just as you are sharers of the sufferings,
00:23:04 in the same way you will also share the comfort.”
00:23:10 At the conclusion of his letter, Paul urged:
00:23:14 “Continue . . . to be comforted, . . .
00:23:17 and the God of love and of peace will be with you.”
00:23:23 What an important lesson we can learn from this!
00:23:27 All members of the Christian congregation
00:23:29 need to share the comfort that God provides through his Word,
00:23:34 his holy spirit, and his earthly organization.
00:23:39 The principal source of comfort is, of course, Jehovah himself.
00:23:44 There’s no real lasting comfort that does not originate with God.
00:23:50 Appropriately, then, Paul wrote:
00:23:53 “[Blessed] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00:23:57 “the Father of tender mercies
00:24:00 “and the God of all comfort,
00:24:02 who comforts us in all our [tribulation].”
00:24:06 What inspiring words!
00:24:11 The Greek word here rendered “comfort”
00:24:14 is linked to “a calling to one side.”
00:24:18 Therefore, it is the standing beside a person to encourage him
00:24:23 when he’s undergoing severe testing.
00:24:27 One Biblical scholar wrote:
00:24:30 “The word . . . always means
00:24:32 “far more than soothing sympathy. . . .
00:24:36 “Christian comfort is the comfort which brings courage,
00:24:40 “the comfort which enables a man to cope
00:24:42 with all that life can do to him.”
00:24:47 It also includes comforting words
00:24:49 that are based on a solid promise and hope
00:24:52 —that of the resurrection of the dead.
00:24:57 So, what can we do to enhance the comfort for others?
00:25:03 Listen.
00:25:04 One of the most helpful things you can do
00:25:07 is to share the bereaved one’s pain by listening.
00:25:11 You may ask, “Would you care to talk about it?”
00:25:16 One Christian recalls when his father died,
00:25:20 “It really helped me when others asked what happened
00:25:24 and then really listened.”
00:25:27 Listen patiently and sympathetically.
00:25:31 “Weep with [people] who weep”
00:25:33 recommends the Bible at Romans 12:15.
00:25:38 Be available.
00:25:40 Make yourself available not just for the first few days
00:25:43 when many friends and relatives are present,
00:25:47 but for months later, if necessary,
00:25:50 when others have returned to their normal routine.
00:25:55 Our Christian interest and sympathy can mean so much
00:25:59 in any time of need.
00:26:02 The Bible says that “there exists a friend
00:26:05 sticking closer than a brother.”
00:26:10 Talk about the good qualities of the deceased person.
00:26:14 This is another great help.
00:26:17 Share positive anecdotes
00:26:20 that you recall about the individual,
00:26:23 and do not be afraid to use the person’s name.
00:26:27 Write a letter or send a comforting card.
00:26:32 Often overlooked is the value of a condolence letter
00:26:36 or a beautiful sympathy card.
00:26:38 Its advantage?
00:26:40 It can be read over and over again.
00:26:44 Such a letter need not be long,
00:26:47 but it should show your compassion.
00:26:51  Pray with them.
00:26:53 Do not underestimate the value of your prayers
00:26:57 with and for bereaved fellow Christians.
00:27:01 The Bible says at James 5:16:
00:27:05 “A righteous man’s supplication . . . has much force.”
00:27:12 Encourage sufferers to meditate on Jehovah.
00:27:16 He’s the God of all comfort.
00:27:19 He said in Isaiah:
00:27:22 “I [I] myself am the One
00:27:25 that is comforting you [people].”
00:27:28 He also said:
00:27:30 “Like a man whom his own mother keeps comforting,
00:27:34 so I myself shall keep comforting you people.”
00:27:41 Find with me Psalm 119.
00:27:45 Let’s first read verses 50, 52:
00:27:52 “This is my comfort in my affliction,
00:27:54 for your saying has preserved me alive.”
00:27:59 Verse 52:
00:28:00 “I remember your judgments from of old,
00:28:03 O Jehovah, and I find comfort in them.”
00:28:08 And now even verse 76:
00:28:11 “May your loyal love please comfort me,
00:28:15 “according to the promise
00:28:17 you made to your servant.”
00:28:21 Note that the word “comfort”
00:28:23 is used repeatedly in those passages.
00:28:27 Yes, we can find true comfort for ourselves and for others
00:28:32 by turning to Jehovah’s Word in our time of affliction.
00:28:37 This combined with the love and compassion of the brothers
00:28:42 can help us to live through our loss and fill our lives again
00:28:47 with joyful activity in the Christian ministry.
00:28:51 What a privilege to worship the Almighty,
00:28:54 our loving God, Jehovah,
00:28:56 who will bring back our loved ones in the resurrection!
00:29:01 There will never again be a pandemic
00:29:03 to claim the life of faithful servants.
00:29:07 Because at that time
00:29:09 “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”
00:29:18 Well, we truly thank you, Brother Lösch,
00:29:20 for those very comforting, loving words.
00:29:23 We really felt your love for the worldwide brotherhood.
00:29:26 And certainly those words were “food at the proper time.”
00:29:31 Well, now we’re going to change the direction somewhat
00:29:35 with a talk from another member of the Governing Body,
00:29:38 Brother Stephen Lett.
00:29:40 His topic is
00:29:42 “We Can Be Victorious Over Satan’s Attack!”
00:29:48 What will you do in the face of Satan’s attack?
00:29:53 Well, that’s a relevant question for all of us here
00:29:57 because without exception,
00:29:59 we’re under a vicious, intense attack.
00:30:03 But the question is,
00:30:05 As the battle intensifies in our individual cases,
00:30:10 will we be able to stand our ground,
00:30:12 bravely fight,
00:30:14 and come off victorious?
00:30:16 Well, obviously your desire is to be victorious—isn’t it?—
00:30:20 or you wouldn’t be attending this special program.
00:30:23 But we need more than just the desire
00:30:28 if we’re going to ensure victory.
00:30:31 In fact, to win any battle,
00:30:34 we need accurate knowledge of three things:
00:30:38 We need to know our enemy,
00:30:40 know his strategy,
00:30:42 and know what we have to defend ourselves.
00:30:45 Now, first, let’s talk about our enemy, Satan.
00:30:49 He is no ordinary foe.
00:30:52 Jehovah educates us regarding this enemy we’re fighting.
00:30:57 For one thing, he’s a premeditative murderer.
00:31:01 Look at what he did to Job’s attendants
00:31:04 —slaughtered them with marauder bands.
00:31:07 Others were consumed with fire.
00:31:10 Look at what he did to Job’s ten children.
00:31:13 He simultaneously murdered
00:31:16 all ten of them with a violent windstorm.
00:31:19 Yes, he’s a premeditative murderer.
00:31:22 He wants to murder into everlasting death every one of us here.
00:31:27 Now, on top of this, he is highly intelligent.
00:31:31 As one brother said,
00:31:33 “He may be evil, wicked, murderous, but he’s not stupid.”
00:31:38 He’s highly intelligent.
00:31:40 In fact, think about this:
00:31:42 The fact that he was once in the truth
00:31:44 makes him more intelligent in a sense, or (we could say) clever,
00:31:48 because he has knowledge of having been in the truth.
00:31:52 John 8:44 says:
00:31:54 “He did not stand fast in the truth.”
00:31:56 But he was in the truth.
00:31:57 Now, to illustrate how this makes him more dangerous,
00:32:01 think about a few of the false brothers
00:32:04 during World War II
00:32:07 who left the truth
00:32:09 and joined the Nazis in persecuting the brothers in the truth.
00:32:14 They had knowledge of who were taking the lead.
00:32:16 They knew where they lived.
00:32:18 They knew the strategy that was being utilized.
00:32:21 They were more dangerous, weren’t they?
00:32:23 Well, it’s the same with Satan.
00:32:25 Second Corinthians 11:14 says:
00:32:28 “Satan . . . keeps disguising himself
00:32:32 as an angel of light.”
00:32:34 Now, it’s very easy for him
00:32:36 to pretend to be what he used to be.
00:32:39 So that makes him more dangerous.
00:32:41 Now, open up, please, to Revelation chapter 12
00:32:44 —a very familiar scripture.
00:32:46 But let’s reason on this to help us further
00:32:50 not to underestimate, or underrate, our enemy
00:32:55 —Revelation 12:7.
00:32:58 “And war broke out in heaven:
00:33:01 “Michael and his angels battled with the dragon,
00:33:05 “and the dragon and its angels battled
00:33:08 “but they did not prevail,
00:33:10 “nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven.
00:33:14 “So down the great dragon was hurled,
00:33:17 “the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan,
00:33:21 “who is misleading the entire inhabited earth;
00:33:25 “he was hurled down to the earth,
00:33:27 and his angels were hurled down with him.”
00:33:30 And then look at verse 12:
00:33:32 “On this account be glad,
00:33:35 “you heavens and you who reside in them!
00:33:39 “Woe for the earth and for the sea,
00:33:41 “because the Devil has come down to you,
00:33:45 “having great anger,
00:33:47 knowing that he has a short period of time.”
00:33:51 Now, you notice, he’s not just mad.
00:33:54 He has “great anger.”
00:33:56 Why is he so angry?
00:33:59 Well, for one thing, after he lost the war in heaven,
00:34:03 he wasn’t merely asked to leave heaven
00:34:05 and then he quietly left.
00:34:08 We read that “he was hurled” out of heaven,
00:34:11 and that denotes thrown with great force.
00:34:15 So that undoubtedly added to his great anger.
00:34:18 But also think about this:
00:34:21 The tremendous reduction of his sphere of movement
00:34:24 adds undoubtedly to his great anger.
00:34:27 Before being cast out of heaven,
00:34:29 apparently he had access
00:34:31 to both the vast, vast physical and spiritual heavens,
00:34:35 but now he’s confined to the vicinity
00:34:39 of this little, tiny earth.
00:34:42 And if you think about it, not only does that make him mad,
00:34:45 it makes him more dangerous, doesn’t it?
00:34:47 Before being cast out of heaven,
00:34:50 undoubtedly he would try to turn away the angels part of the time
00:34:55 and he would try to turn away humans.
00:34:57 He was divided in his attention.
00:34:59 But now we have his undivided attention, don’t we?
00:35:04 So that’s bad for us, and that makes him dangerous.
00:35:07 Here’s another illustration about the increasing of the danger.
00:35:11 I’d like you to imagine that all of the Mafia members,
00:35:16 all of the drug cartel members,
00:35:19 and all of the terrorists on the entire planet Earth were gathered up
00:35:24 and were confined to New York City, the city limits,
00:35:28 and you lived there too.
00:35:30 Now, can you imagine the escalation of crime and evil
00:35:33 that would take place there?
00:35:35 Additionally, we read that he’s mad and angry
00:35:39 because he knows his time is short.
00:35:42 Now, if that was true back around 1914,
00:35:46 what about today, over 100 years later?
00:35:49 He knows his expiration date is almost here.
00:35:53 So you add it all up, and his anger
00:35:55 is truly, really white hot, you could say.
00:36:00 And he has hordes of demon helpers.
00:36:03 That makes him more dangerous too.
00:36:05 Do you think it would be possible
00:36:07 for a demon to block one of Jehovah’s good angels?
00:36:11 Well, be careful how you answer that.
00:36:13 Daniel 10:13
00:36:16 talks about the demon prince of Persia
00:36:19 blocking Jehovah’s good angel “for 21 days.”
00:36:24 Now, how was that possible?
00:36:26 Well, we don’t know for sure,
00:36:27 but perhaps the demon prince
00:36:29 before becoming a demon had been a cherub or a seraph.
00:36:34 And maybe the one sent on the assignment was a messenger angel.
00:36:38 Of course, Michael came to help the good angel,
00:36:41 and he was able to get past that demon.
00:36:44 But that scripture and others
00:36:46 help us not to underestimate the demons.
00:36:50 We can’t underestimate “the ruler of the demons”
00:36:52 nor these demons who work under his supervision.
00:36:57 So adding it up,
00:36:59 we find that Satan is a premeditative murderer.
00:37:03 He’s highly intelligent.
00:37:06 He has great anger
00:37:08 because of his great reduction of sphere of movement
00:37:11 and because of his expiration of time,
00:37:14 and he has hordes of demon helpers.
00:37:17 Now, Jehovah has given us all this information,
00:37:20 not just to fill up pages in the Bible
00:37:23 but so that we are determined
00:37:25 to recognize the enemy we’re up against
00:37:28 and that we’re determined to fight even harder
00:37:30 so that we can be victorious.
00:37:33 But now let’s take a little time
00:37:35 to get to know our enemy’s strategy.
00:37:39 Again, thanks to Jehovah, we’re not in the dark, are we?
00:37:42 Second Corinthians 2:11 says
00:37:45 “so that we may not be overreached by Satan,
00:37:49 for we are not ignorant of his designs.”
00:37:54 Why are we not ignorant?
00:37:56 Well, very kindly Jehovah has exposed
00:37:59 the full spectrum of Satan’s designs,
00:38:03 his strategies, his maneuvers.
00:38:05 He’s exposed all of them in his Word, the Bible.
00:38:09 Now that’s very kind of Jehovah —isn’t it?—
00:38:11 very kind of Jehovah.
00:38:13 Even though the Bible was written (the completion of it)
00:38:17 over 1,900 years ago,
00:38:19 Jehovah, let’s say 100 years after the Bible had been written,
00:38:24 didn’t come to the realization:
00:38:26 ‘Oh, no! I forgot to put one of Satan’s tricks in the Bible.
00:38:31 Oh, no! My people won’t be ready for it.’
00:38:33 No, Jehovah has exposed every one of them
00:38:37 in his Word, the Bible.
00:38:40 Well, what two basic categories
00:38:43 does God’s Word indicate
00:38:45 that Satan’s strategies can be divided into?
00:38:48 Well, first, we have the frontal attack.
00:38:51 Now, that’s characterized by bannings, imprisonments,
00:38:55 threats, and acts of violence,
00:38:58 such as were used on our brothers in Malawi in the past
00:39:01 and are being used today in Russia on our brothers.
00:39:05 And you don’t have to scratch your head and say,
00:39:07 ‘I wonder if I’m being persecuted.’
00:39:10 When you have the frontal attack, it’s obvious, isn’t it?
00:39:12 It’s clear—the frontal attack.
00:39:15 Has this proved to be Satan’s most successful method of attack?
00:39:21 No, not really.
00:39:23 Here’s just one experience
00:39:25 out of thousands that could be related to substantiate this point.
00:39:29 Now, this experience centers
00:39:32 around a 29-year-old brother
00:39:34 named August Dickmann.
00:39:37 Now, you probably remember this experience.
00:39:39 He was put in Sachsenhausen concentration camp
00:39:42 in 1937,
00:39:44 but then three days
00:39:46 after World War II began
00:39:50 in 1939,
00:39:52 he was ordered to sign his military induction slip.
00:39:56 Of course, he refused to do that.
00:39:58 Now, the camp commander was furious.
00:40:01 So he got permission from Himmler,
00:40:04 the head of the SS guard,
00:40:07 to publicly execute August
00:40:10 in front of all the camp inmates.
00:40:13 And he arranged a special assembly
00:40:17 after he got this permission,
00:40:19 and he had Jehovah’s Witnesses right down in front,
00:40:21 where they would get the full impact of the execution of our dear brother.
00:40:26 Well, after he was executed,
00:40:29 all the other inmates were dismissed,
00:40:32 but Jehovah’s Witnesses had to stay.
00:40:34 And with great enthusiasm,
00:40:37 the camp commander said to the Witnesses there,
00:40:41 he said, “Who is now ready to sign the declaration?”
00:40:47 Well, not one
00:40:49 of more than 400 Witnesses responded.
00:40:52 But then two stepped forward.
00:40:56 No, not to sign
00:40:58 but to ask that their signatures given about a year earlier
00:41:02 be annulled.
00:41:04 What a slap in Satan’s face!
00:41:07 And that really illustrates
00:41:09 the poor success rate of this frontal attack, see,
00:41:12 and many other experiences could be related.
00:41:15 And it’s certainly proving true
00:41:17 of our brothers in Russia today, including elderly ones.
00:41:20 The frontal attack has a very poor success rate
00:41:24 —a slap in Satan’s face.
00:41:26 But, now, what is the second category of strategy
00:41:30 that sadly has claimed many spiritual victims?
00:41:34 Let’s go to Ephesians chapter 6,
00:41:38 and here we can identify in verse 11
00:41:42 this second category.
00:41:45 “Put on the complete suit of armor from God
00:41:49 “so that you may be able to stand firm
00:41:52 against the crafty acts of the Devil.”
00:41:57 So notice that —“crafty,” sneaky, underhanded, devious.
00:42:01 Satan uses these,
00:42:04 and he’s brought down many away from Jehovah and out of the truth.
00:42:09 These “crafty acts” remind me
00:42:12 of an illustration years ago
00:42:14 in one of our publications of a soldier
00:42:17 who was looking in the distance for the enemy to come over the horizon.
00:42:21 He was looking for the frontal attack,
00:42:23 but he wasn’t looking in the rocks down by his feet.
00:42:26 There was a poisonous snake lurking.
00:42:29 And that powerfully made the point:
00:42:30 You have to watch, yes, for the frontal attack
00:42:33 but especially for the snake-in-the-rocks attacks of the Devil
00:42:38 that can really bring you down without you realizing what has happened.
00:42:42 But Jehovah assures us that we can succeed
00:42:46 in triumphing over both of these categories of attacks.
00:42:51 In fact, Psalm 91:13 is a beautiful thought.
00:42:55 It says, and Jehovah assures:
00:42:57 “You will trample underfoot
00:43:00 “the maned lion
00:43:03 and  the big snake.”
00:43:06 And the Insight  book explains that apparently in that scripture,
00:43:10 “the maned lion” represents the frontal attack,
00:43:13 the open attacks of Satan,
00:43:16 whereas “the big snake” represents the sneaky, crafty acts of the Devil.
00:43:20 But Jehovah says “you will trample” both of them “underfoot.”
00:43:25 So we can be successful over both of them.
00:43:28 Well, what are some of these snakelike, crafty acts?
00:43:32 Well, let’s just discuss two examples.
00:43:34 Here’s one: materialism.
00:43:37 Now, this has brought down many elders, ministerial servants,
00:43:42 pioneers, publishers —a very successful crafty act of the Devil.
00:43:46 It’s no coincidence that this world
00:43:50 is powerfully geared to promote materialism.
00:43:55 Relentless advertising messages
00:43:57 are designed to indoctrinate deeply
00:44:00 the idea that acquiring abundant material possessions
00:44:05 and acquiring happiness
00:44:07 are inseparably linked and directly proportional.
00:44:11 That’s really the message the world gives.
00:44:14 Isn’t that true?
00:44:16 And if we’re not careful, we can begin to think
00:44:19 like these advertising messages want us to think
00:44:22 —that we’re a poor, poor loser
00:44:25 if we don’t acquire abundant material things.
00:44:28 So, what can happen?
00:44:29 We could get sucked into this little by little.
00:44:32 We buy one item.
00:44:33 No problem, we can handle that.
00:44:36 We buy something else.
00:44:38 Well, now we need to work a little bit of overtime
00:44:40 to make the payments.
00:44:42 We keep buying.
00:44:43 Now we need to take a second job.
00:44:45 Little by little, we’re missing meetings, service,
00:44:48 and there’s less time for personal study —“the more important things.”
00:44:52 And little by little
00:44:54 (we could call Satan the god of gradualism),
00:44:58 he’ll take us away from Jehovah by means of materialism.
00:45:02 Well, here’s one more example:
00:45:04 bad association.
00:45:07 At 1 Corinthians 15:33, Jehovah says:
00:45:11 “Do not be misled.
00:45:14 Bad associations spoil useful habits.”
00:45:19 We might try to mislead ourselves:
00:45:21 ‘Oh, I can handle it; I’m strong enough.
00:45:24 Maybe I’ll even bring this person into the truth.’
00:45:27 Or others may try to mislead us.
00:45:29 But Jehovah says: “Do not be misled.”
00:45:32 And then he gives the terrible consequences.
00:45:36 Think of this illustration:
00:45:38 If you lock a man and a skunk in a closet,
00:45:44 when they come out, will the skunk smell like the man
00:45:49 or will the man smell like the skunk?
00:45:51 Well, you know the answer,
00:45:53 and Jehovah knows it works the same way with bad association.
00:45:59 Well, those are just two examples of crafty acts of the Devil.
00:46:03 There are many others.
00:46:05 They’re all exposed, though, as we said before.
00:46:06 Jehovah kindly has done that.
00:46:09 But now think of this.
00:46:10 Think of this illustration: If you’re walking in darkness
00:46:13 with a loving friend
00:46:15 and he shines a flashlight on a trap
00:46:19 that is right in front of you,
00:46:22 does the light of that flashlight remove the trap?
00:46:25 No, it just shows you where it is.
00:46:28 Now it’s up to us to go around the trap.
00:46:31 Isn’t that true?
00:46:32 How foolish to go ahead and step in that trap
00:46:34 that our friend has illuminated!
00:46:36 Well, Jehovah is the Friend in that illustration.
00:46:40 But we have to do our part, don’t we?
00:46:42 Well, we’ve thus far discussed our evil enemy
00:46:47 and his sinister strategy, which Jehovah has exposed.
00:46:51 But, now, what do we have to defend ourselves?
00:46:54 One major component of our defenses
00:46:58 is knowledge, see,
00:47:00 what we’ve just discussed:
00:47:02 knowing our enemy, knowing his strategy,
00:47:06 and then wisely utilizing that knowledge
00:47:09 provides a real protection for us.
00:47:12 There’s a saying, “To be forewarned
00:47:16 is to be forearmed.”
00:47:18 Similarly, Proverbs 4:5, 6 says in part:
00:47:24 “Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding . . . ,
00:47:28 and it will protect you.”
00:47:31 But now, additionally, we have our spiritual armor.
00:47:34 Ephesians 6:12, 13 says in part:
00:47:38 “We have a struggle . . .
00:47:40 “against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.
00:47:45 “For this reason
00:47:47 “take up the complete suit of armor from God,
00:47:51 “so that you may be able to resist . . .
00:47:54 and . . . stand firm.”
00:47:56 We’ve had some beautiful Watchtower  study articles recently
00:48:00 about each of those six pieces of that armor
00:48:04 and how we can put on and keep on each piece of the armor.
00:48:08 Without our armor, we are defenseless.
00:48:12 We’d be like a soldier on a raging battlefield,
00:48:16 dressed only in his underwear.
00:48:21 How long do you think he would survive?
00:48:23 Minutes, if that long.
00:48:26 And not only do we need the armor, but we need every piece of the armor.
00:48:30 And that’s what Ephesians 6:13 says, “the complete suit of armor.”
00:48:35 One piece of armor missing could be tragic.
00:48:39 Now, let’s illustrate this.
00:48:41 Let’s say a soldier forgets to put on his bootlike sandals.
00:48:45 He goes out into this raging battlefield,
00:48:48 and he steps on a long, sharp thorn
00:48:52 just as he’s attacked by an enemy soldier.
00:48:54 Who is going to win?
00:48:56 Well, it’s obvious.
00:48:57 We need every piece of the armor.
00:49:00 Additionally, an indispensable part of our defense system
00:49:04 is Jehovah’s holy spirit.
00:49:06 At Zechariah 4:6, the thought is made:
00:49:11 “‘Not by a military force, nor by power,
00:49:15 but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.”
00:49:20 See, we don’t fight this battle in our own strength.
00:49:23 We have to have Jehovah’s holy spirit.
00:49:26 And if we have holy spirit  and we’re empowered by it,
00:49:30 if we think about it, there is no breaking point to our integrity.
00:49:35 You probably have heard the illustration
00:49:37 of the straw that broke the camel’s back.
00:49:39 And literally with a camel,
00:49:41 you could keep piling more and more weight,
00:49:44 so that finally you could put so much weight
00:49:46 (just a little more weight) that you could break its back.
00:49:48 Satan could do that to us —couldn’t he?—
00:49:51 if we were on our own.
00:49:53 But Jehovah knows when we’ve done our part
00:49:56 and we’ve gone as far as our imperfect flesh will take us,
00:49:59 and then he steps in and makes up any deficit.
00:50:04 Satan piles more; Jehovah makes up for the shortfall.
00:50:08 Satan piles more; Jehovah makes us equal to that challenge.
00:50:12 And since Jehovah is the Almighty,
00:50:14 there is literally no breaking point to our integrity.
00:50:19 In fact, one brother living in a banned country
00:50:22 refused to violate his Christian neutrality,
00:50:25 so he was stripped naked, forced to lie facedown,
00:50:29 and ruthlessly beaten for six hours on his back and his legs.
00:50:34 Spectators fainted because it was so ruthless.
00:50:37 But yet, here’s what that brother said sometime later.
00:50:40 He said: “Regardless of the amount
00:50:42 “of insulting and beatings that we received,
00:50:46 “a few seconds would pass
00:50:49 “and we would not feel anything more
00:50:51 “even though the beatings continued.
00:50:54 We were feeling that Jehovah God was always with us.”
00:51:00 Well, there we have three aspects of our defense system.
00:51:04 There are others.
00:51:05 But we discussed that we have God-given knowledge:
00:51:09 We know our enemy, we know his strategy,
00:51:11 and we know what we have to defend ourselves.
00:51:13 But then we have our spiritual armor,
00:51:16 and we have Jehovah’s holy spirit.
00:51:18 If we do our part,
00:51:21 unquestionably Jehovah always does his part.
00:51:25 And this combination is going to be unconquerable.
00:51:29 So as the battle intensifies in our individual cases,
00:51:34 we’re not going to have to turn and cowardly flee.
00:51:38 We’ll be able to stand our ground.
00:51:41 We’ll be able to bravely fight,
00:51:43 and with Jehovah’s help,
00:51:45 we will come off completely victorious
00:51:48 in the face of Satan’s attack.
00:51:58 We thank you so much, Brother Lett,
00:52:00 for that encouragement and that strength
00:52:03 that “no weapon formed against [God’s people]
00:52:06 will have any success.”
00:52:09 And it’s a good opportunity to remember the 129
00:52:14 of our dear brothers and sisters around the world
00:52:17 who are presently in prison because of their faith.
00:52:20 Do you remember what Hebrews 13:3 says?
00:52:24 “Keep in mind those in prison,
00:52:27 “as though you were imprisoned with them,
00:52:31 “and those being mistreated,
00:52:33 since you yourselves also are in the body.”
00:52:37 We certainly love and respect
00:52:39 our brothers in Russia and in many other lands
00:52:42 who are facing cruel persecution.
00:52:46 Well, we still have two members
00:52:48 of the Governing Body that we want to hear from.
00:52:51 But before we do, we would like to give you an update
00:52:55 on the project that Audio/Video Services
00:52:57 is spearheading at the Australasia branch.
00:53:01 You’ll recall that it was announced at last year’s annual meeting.
00:53:05 So, what has been happening
00:53:07 with this video project in this intervening time?
00:53:09 Please pay close attention.
00:53:14 At the 2020 annual meeting,
00:53:16 we announced an exciting new video project,
00:53:19 The Good News According to Jesus.
00:53:22 Brother Anthony Morris made the following encouraging statement.
00:53:27 Will there be challenges?
00:53:29 Oh yeah, guaranteed.
00:53:31 But if Jehovah wants something done,
00:53:33 that’s what happens.
00:53:36 How true those words have proven to be!
00:53:40 To date, the largest feature drama
00:53:43 Audio/Video Services had produced
00:53:45 was a little over 100 minutes in length.
00:53:49 The Good News According to Jesus spans nearly 1,000 minutes of content!
00:53:55 We are happy to update you on this exciting project
00:53:59 and share different ways Jehovah has helped us to overcome various challenges.
00:54:06 Brothers and sisters already serving at the Australasia branch were key
00:54:11 to helping us get the facilities ready.
00:54:14 How did they handle this special assignment, especially during the pandemic?
00:54:21 We were all very excited,
00:54:23 but as the scope
00:54:24 of this project became clear,
00:54:26 there were times when we wondered how
00:54:28 our small publisher base of around 68,000
00:54:31 would be able to fully support this large undertaking.
00:54:34 We’re a small department,
00:54:36 and it’s a small branch that we’re at.
00:54:38 And all of a sudden,
00:54:40 we had this project highlighted
00:54:42 that was three times our normal workload.
00:54:44 Right after we received approval for the project, the branch territory
00:54:49 experienced terrible bushfires raging right throughout the country.
00:54:54 Straight after this were floods.
00:54:56 So, many of our brothers experienced double disasters.
00:54:59 As we then started to recover from this
00:55:02 and build momentum to start the project,
00:55:04 the COVID-19 pandemic began.
00:55:09 All of the deliveries of construction materials
00:55:11 coming into the branch had to be quarantined
00:55:13 (all of the bulk supplies that the Construction Department was using).
00:55:17 And so that meant there was a time period
00:55:19 for those things to be unavailable for use.
00:55:21 And then the logistics
00:55:23 of (once all those bulk supplies came out of quarantine)
00:55:25 then moving them to where they’re needed on the site
00:55:27 when new deliveries are coming in and managing
00:55:30 that safely with the COVID-19 risks
00:55:32 and the risks of interaction with the delivery drivers and the contractors
00:55:36 —it was complicated and very time-consuming for all involved.
00:55:40 We needed help from our brothers  and sisters outside of Bethel.
00:55:43 So we put the call out, and they came from all over
00:55:46 the branch territory to help.
00:55:48 Many of them traveled days on rough and rugged roads
00:55:52 to come and help us.
00:55:53 When they arrived,
00:55:55 they spent a time in quarantine, and then they were able to come
00:55:57 and help us safely on-site.
00:56:01 There were specific items
00:56:02 needed for the project.
00:56:03 So we asked the brothers and sisters
00:56:05 to help to see where or how
00:56:07 we could obtain them.
00:56:08 It was so heartwarming to see all the responses flooding in.
00:56:12 Within a short amount of time, we had received offers
00:56:15 for donations or loans  for much of the heavy machinery
00:56:19 or large equipment we needed
00:56:21 and even things like plants for landscaping.
00:56:25 So we brought in a number of temporary workers,
00:56:27 and a number of remote workers as well were added to the team.
00:56:30 And the Branch Committee made available a large car parking area
00:56:33 so that we could quarantine off all of the deliveries
00:56:35 and handle those things safely and in line with the guidelines.
00:56:39 So at the beginning of the project,
00:56:40 the number was about 200 people
00:56:43 in the family,
00:56:44 and that quickly grew to around 500.
00:56:47 And while we have a beautiful kitchen here to serve food from,
00:56:52 it wasn’t really designed for 500 meals each day.
00:56:56 The Branch Committee
00:56:58 as well as our various departments,
00:57:00 although they had a heavy workload themselves,
00:57:02 were able to extend a helping hand.
00:57:05 Where we lost commuters,
00:57:07 we gained some workers from various departments
00:57:11 who helped us in various tasks within Food Service.
00:57:16 So it was clear to everybody in the department and at the branch
00:57:20 that it really needed to be a team effort,
00:57:22 and everybody went above and beyond to make this work.
00:57:25 But that only takes you so far.
00:57:28 Jehovah’s blessing on the arrangements,
00:57:30 the qualities that he helps us to show,
00:57:32 the motivation that he helps us to have
00:57:34 to overcome those challenges and to take on things that really
00:57:39 are beyond what we can normally cope with
00:57:42 —seeing that particularly as we look back on a number
00:57:44 of those challenges and how they’ve been overcome—
00:57:47 you see Jehovah’s involvement day to day.
00:57:49 A brother had a trailer  that was going to be donated to the project,
00:57:53 but he didn’t have the funds to pay for the freight.
00:57:57 At the very same time, a sister contacted the branch
00:58:00 and wanted to donate specifically to the project.
00:58:03 The amount she donated was the amount that was needed
00:58:06 to cover the freight to bring the trailer to Bethel.
00:58:09 One brother made a 30-hour round-trip to deliver
00:58:13 a large quantity of goods he manufactured for us.
00:58:16 He made this trip, not once or twice, but multiple times,
00:58:20 even planning the work  around two surgeries he had to have.
00:58:24 A number of trucks were required to freight the goods,
00:58:28 so members of his family and congregation
00:58:30 shared in the driving while local brothers extended hospitality.
00:58:35 I’m very impressed
00:58:37 with the level of appreciation
00:58:40 and the sense of gratitude that permeates the family.
00:58:43 And seeing that is
00:58:46 a real boost for us and a real blessing.
00:58:50 We feel very appreciative for everyone who’s been able to help on this project,
00:58:54 and we recognize the personal
00:58:56 and collective sacrifices that have been made.
00:58:59 And those who have been able to come in and help us on the project
00:59:02 tell us how thankful they are to have had a share in the project.
00:59:06 Only Jehovah can create a situation like this.
00:59:11 Jehovah always finds a way to help us do his will,
00:59:16 often providing solutions we never thought possible.
00:59:21 In addition to preparing the Australasia facility for the project,
00:59:25 much work has been done
00:59:27 with script development, casting, and location scouting.
00:59:32 How has this progressed?
00:59:36 We recognized that there
00:59:38 would be many needed adjustments
00:59:42 to the branch there
00:59:43 as far as facilities are concerned.
00:59:46 We knew that there would be the need
00:59:48 for many volunteers to be involved
00:59:50 in the project, and we knew it was going to be
00:59:54 coordinated from halfway around the world.
00:59:58 The challenge with finding locations
00:59:59 for the Gospel accounts
01:00:01 is that they need to look like ancient lands
01:00:04 but be placed in a modern world.
01:00:06 They need to have no signs of civilization
01:00:10 and yet be close enough to civilization to support our modern filming operations.
01:00:16 You’re asked to flesh out an entire world,
01:00:19 a culture,
01:00:21 and hundreds or, actually, thousands
01:00:23 of characters that appear in these accounts
01:00:26 and to do so with very limited information
01:00:28 actually in the Bible.
01:00:30 How do we add enough details to connect with the audience
01:00:33 but do so without overstepping by introducing teachings
01:00:37 or ideas that contradict the Bible’s message?
01:00:42 We can truly say it was a worldwide effort on the part of our brothers and sisters.
01:00:46 It was especially encouraging
01:00:49 to see how young ones
01:00:51 responded to this need.
01:00:53 They were looking to extend themselves
01:00:55 in their service to Jehovah, and they were willing
01:00:57 to adjust their secular jobs.
01:00:59 They were willing to move
01:01:01 to other locations in order to be able
01:01:04 to support this project.
01:01:07 We were looking at how we could
01:01:08 accomplish so many auditions
01:01:11 in a shorter period of time.
01:01:13 So we came up with the idea of a self-guided audition
01:01:17 where we put a package together
01:01:20 identifying how the audition needs
01:01:22 to be accomplished and we send it to the publisher that’s being auditioned,
01:01:27 and they record their own audition
01:01:29 and send it back to us for processing.
01:01:33 While we were at some of the locations, we actually did test filming.
01:01:36 We put actors in wardrobe in front of the camera and re-created certain scenes
01:01:40 to see how this location could be used for our project.
01:01:44 We were able to travel to more than a dozen locations during a month,
01:01:48 and everyone returned happy and healthy.
01:01:52 There are some accounts in the Gospels
01:01:54 that reference large groups,
01:01:55 such as the Sermon on the Mount
01:01:57 and when Jesus preached from the boat.
01:01:59 How would we show that many people?
01:02:01 The team took time to test various methods,
01:02:04 including some computer graphics as well as different styles
01:02:09 and methods to be used to duplicate people
01:02:12 for these large crowds.
01:02:14 The production team was able to see
01:02:17 what did and did not work, and this is very beneficial because it helps
01:02:21 us to plan appropriately for the actual production day.
01:02:26 And so it’s simply a matter of going and doing
01:02:28 as much research as possible to find out what is known.
01:02:30 And, of course, there’s an entire team
01:02:33 devoted to doing research for our publications.
01:02:35 And we have access to those brothers and sisters.
01:02:38 Something that has been incredibly valuable for every screenwriter
01:02:41 on this project is to see
01:02:44 members of the Teaching Committee sit at every table read for each script
01:02:48 and then proceed to give us direction,
01:02:50 ask questions, give us direction
01:02:53 on what to go and research further, what to remove, and (in many cases)
01:02:57 what to add.
01:02:58 It shows how deeply they’re
01:03:00 invested in the story of Jesus’ life.
01:03:03 It felt like Jehovah had taken us and placed us
01:03:06 into a land thousands of years ago.
01:03:10 When we got to these various locations, we literally would
01:03:14 jump out of the vehicles and run across the landscape
01:03:16 in excitement for how we could potentially use them.
01:03:19 One of the biggest challenges we had was getting everyone back into the vehicles
01:03:23 so that we could go on to the next location.
01:03:26 We went to one property, and when we talked with the brother,
01:03:29 he said: “This isn’t my property.
01:03:32 “This belongs to Jehovah.
01:03:34 “I’m holding onto it (I’m not sure why),
01:03:37 hoping that perhaps Jehovah can use it in some way.”
01:03:40 And when you think  about all of our brothers and sisters
01:03:44 coming together to support this initiative,
01:03:47 it really has been a blessing to be able to witness that.
01:03:50 It really reminds me of what is said
01:03:52 at Psalm 133:1, where it said it would be “good”
01:03:56 to see brothers and sisters ‘dwelling together in unity.’
01:03:59 And we’ve seen that goodness.
01:04:01 We’ve seen our brotherhood really rally around supporting this project
01:04:05 in so many ways.
01:04:07 And it has contributed toward
01:04:09 a spirit that has allowed Jehovah to bless the work.
01:04:14 Would you like to see how the design and construction aspects
01:04:17 of the work are progressing, including the historical sets?
01:04:22 Well, one of the biggest challenges we’ve had
01:04:25 in the Design/Construction world
01:04:27 is to get the mentality
01:04:29 that we’re designing and building something
01:04:32 that needs to look 2,000 years old.
01:04:36 Now, we’re used to building modern buildings,
01:04:38 and we’re used to using the materials
01:04:39 that we have today,
01:04:40 but to now use those
01:04:42 to provide something that was ancient,
01:04:43 that was going to be quite the challenge.
01:04:47 In Jesus’ ministry,
01:04:48 he went to numerous different towns,
01:04:50 and those towns
01:04:51 would have had different looks
01:04:52 because of the natural products
01:04:54 that were available to the tradesmen then to build those buildings.
01:05:01 Back in ancient Israel,
01:05:02 the building materials would have been stone,
01:05:04 so they would have used limestone, basalt,
01:05:07 field stones, and even clay bricks.
01:05:09 There’s probably
01:05:11 just over 100 doors and gates out there.
01:05:15 There are also over 200 windows,
01:05:18 and we’ve got shutters, and all of these need
01:05:20 either timber lintels or timber sills.
01:05:24 You have tradesmen who are used to getting things,
01:05:27 you could say, nearly perfect.
01:05:29 Normally as a renderer, or a plasterer, you would cover up cracks,
01:05:33 but here we’re having to actually create these.
01:05:36 That can be quite a challenge.
01:05:40 Back a few years ago, there were various branches
01:05:42 that were put forward as possibilities, as options.
01:05:46 And in the end, the Australasia branch was chosen.
01:05:49 At that time in the Design/Construction world,
01:05:52 we thought, ‘Well, that was an interesting choice.’
01:05:55 But during 2020, during the pandemic, we found out in retrospect
01:06:00 that it was one of the only places on earth
01:06:03 where this project could be completed now.
01:06:05 Because of the low incidence of COVID in the country,
01:06:09 we were able to use outside contractors
01:06:11 to come in to the project to do part of the site work for us.
01:06:15 So it’s been a blessing to have the project take place
01:06:19 at this location.
01:06:21 Those that we had on-site here already were very
01:06:24 open-minded, and they had a lot of creative thinking
01:06:28 when it came to building historical
01:06:31 sets now with modern materials.
01:06:34 So we have about 7,000 square meters of render to accomplish,
01:06:39 and we’ll have two teams working full-time
01:06:43 for several months to accomplish this.
01:06:51 In this particular type of work, nobody’s trade really counted;
01:06:55 everybody had to try.
01:06:57 And many of our sisters, in fact,
01:06:59 were the ones that had the skills that were needed to create
01:07:01 the historical effect that was required.
01:07:07 To achieve the weathering that would happen on the stone
01:07:11 if it sat there for hundreds of years out in the weather—
01:07:14 The water would get into the stone and slowly break it down.
01:07:18 So then there are going to be areas
01:07:20 of the stone that are softer, so they’ll wear away quicker.
01:07:23 So then that’s done with the wire brush.
01:07:27 And then some spots with the acetone,
01:07:30 it puts little divots into the stone,
01:07:32 which occur naturally in limestone.
01:07:36 Once the project is completed in the backlot,
01:07:38 the brothers and sisters will have applied
01:07:40 up to four and a half thousand square meters of stone finish to the buildings.
01:07:50 It’s been amazing to see how
01:07:53 with a variety of backgrounds (despite this),
01:07:57 they’ve been able to achieve quite amazing things
01:08:01 with just their willing spirit, prepared to take
01:08:05 on board the instruction.
01:08:06 And we can see Jehovah’s blessing behind it.
01:08:10 In the temple area, in the backlot, there are a little over 4,000 square meters
01:08:14 of concrete that has been made to look like stone.
01:08:18 Well, one of the contractors who quoted on the job was actually a brother.
01:08:22 And that particular brother said: “Well, you know what?
01:08:25 “I can volunteer to do this.
01:08:26 “And there are enough brothers around that we can bring together,
01:08:29 and we would be more than happy to be able to do it on a volunteer basis.”
01:08:33 So an isolated area was set up
01:08:35 where these brothers could test and sample and produce
01:08:39 the concrete that was needed for the floor finish of the temple.
01:08:42 So for over 27 days of straight pours,
01:08:45 we had approximately 30 brothers and sisters
01:08:48 each day come in and work tirelessly
01:08:50 to be able to accomplish
01:08:51 this temple floor for us.
01:08:55 The last day of the concrete pour,
01:08:57 we wanted to surprise the brothers,
01:09:00 because someone had made a sign saying: “United in spirit.”
01:09:03 But actually, the construction Bethelites surprised us.
01:09:07 They all had balloons and signs, and it spelled out “Thank you.”
01:09:11 I think that just reflected how we love each other
01:09:14 and how we’d give our life for each other
01:09:16 because we both serve the same God and we love Jehovah.
01:09:20 Through lots of sleepless nights and a bit of prayer about it,
01:09:24 we ended up finding a brother who owned a sawmill and had property
01:09:28 with trees on it, and he willingly chopped down the trees
01:09:32 on his property and provided them for us
01:09:34 —delivered them to site and actually donated them to us.
01:09:37 And they were exactly what we needed.
01:09:40 We also had specific prayers at certain times about certain matters,
01:09:44 and then 30 minutes later, we’d receive answers.
01:09:47 That definitely also is no coincidence.
01:09:49 And then obviously getting the right approvals just at the right time
01:09:54 despite objections—we know that there’s no one else other than
01:09:57 Jehovah that could have a hand in that.
01:09:59 So it’s obvious that Satan has put everything he can in front of us,
01:10:04 but Jehovah has provided every time at the right time.
01:10:08 It’s no coincidence that his hand has been on this,
01:10:11 and there is no doubt that he wants people to know about his Son, Jesus.
01:10:16 Seeing the collaboration in our monthly meetings
01:10:19 with the entire team where we have
01:10:21 the World Headquarters Legal Department, the World Headquarters Computer Department,
01:10:25 we have the Purchasing Department, we have Design/Construction,
01:10:28 we have the Regional Video Teams, we have Audio/Video Services
01:10:31 —all of these groups along with the branch in Australasia—
01:10:35 working together for a common goal as a team
01:10:40 has been amazing and a very faith-strengthening experience.
01:10:45 We were happy to share this update with you.
01:10:48 But you might still be wondering:
01:10:51 ‘How are actors being prepared to reach our hearts through their performance?
01:10:57 ‘How will the tone and filming style be selected to represent
01:11:01 the Gospel accounts?’
01:11:03 And maybe the biggest question you have is,
01:11:06 When will cameras start rolling?
01:11:09 Stay tuned for a future update.
01:11:13 Imagine the powerful impact
01:11:16 this video series will have on people!
01:11:19 It will help you and me follow Jesus’ footsteps closely.
01:11:23 It will help us draw closer to Jehovah,
01:11:27 whom Jesus perfectly imitated as a human.
01:11:30 But the benefits go far beyond you and me.
01:11:34 As stated in the 2020 annual meeting,
01:11:37 it is likely that this series will be used to touch the hearts and minds
01:11:42 of billions of resurrected ones in the coming new world.
01:11:47 Just think how this video series could help them
01:11:51 learn about the example that Jesus set.
01:11:55 Imagine how the visual portrayal of his warm, humble,
01:12:00 and approachable personality
01:12:02 will help them to come to know Jehovah intimately.
01:12:06 How exactly will we use this new series to teach resurrected ones?
01:12:11 We will have to wait and see what Jehovah directs.
01:12:16 We are confident Jehovah is blessing this work.
01:12:20 And we will continue  to look to Jehovah for direction
01:12:24 as we move ahead with The Good News According to Jesus.
01:12:42 Well, as you likely noticed,
01:12:44 when this video production was first starting,
01:12:47 Australia was one of the countries
01:12:50 that had the least impact from the pandemic.
01:12:52 And so that allowed this large project
01:12:55 to move ahead and gain momentum.
01:12:57 Even though later the pandemic
01:13:00 affected Australia much more seriously,
01:13:03 all of the preparations were underway.
01:13:06 We truly thank Jehovah for the tremendous progress
01:13:10 that has been made on this project so far.
01:13:15 Well, now we have another treat.
01:13:17 We’re going to hear from another member of the Governing Body,
01:13:21 Brother Samuel Herd.
01:13:23 His theme is actually a quote from the Bible.
01:13:26 Are you ready?
01:13:28 The title is “I Will Never Abandon You.”
01:13:36 I spoke to Jehovah just before I stepped out here.
01:13:39 And I asked him:
01:13:41 “Please don’t abandon me.
01:13:47 If I’ve ever needed you, I need you now.”
01:13:50 Why?
01:13:51 Well, it’s because of all of these beautiful sheep
01:13:55 that I have the privilege to speak to for 19 minutes.
01:14:01 So I want to make the most of these 19 minutes,
01:14:04 because sometimes we have to make adjustments.
01:14:07 Now, you may have heard of a few adjustments
01:14:10 in our understanding of things already today.
01:14:14 And there could be more adjustments
01:14:16 that will have to be made later on.
01:14:21 Now, you may recall that we
01:14:23 used to think a certain way some ten years ago
01:14:28 about the following matter.
01:14:31 We felt that some of the anointed
01:14:33 would survive Armageddon
01:14:37 and move right on into the Paradise
01:14:39 with the other sheep
01:14:42 and maybe stay there for a given time
01:14:46 and then be brought to life in heaven.
01:14:51 But as we understand it,
01:14:55 some things Jehovah will not permit us to see,
01:14:58 even though we read over it many, many times.
01:15:03 We can’t see it until Jehovah
01:15:06 puts the light on it.
01:15:09 And what I’m about to reveal to you today,
01:15:13 Jehovah is behind it
01:15:16 —not the Governing Body,
01:15:18 not any human here on the earth, but Jehovah God.
01:15:22 He helps us to see things.
01:15:24 Now, you may recall
01:15:27 Matthew chapter 24
01:15:29 verses 29-31.
01:15:32 You’ve read it many times; I have too.
01:15:36 But notice what it says,
01:15:39 even though we felt a little differently
01:15:42 earlier on when we read it
01:15:46 —verse 29:
01:15:48 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days
01:15:53 “[now remember this,
01:15:55 “immediately after the tribulation of those days],
01:15:59 “the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,
01:16:03 “and the stars will fall from heaven,
01:16:06 “and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
01:16:09 “Then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven,
01:16:14 “and all the tribes of the earth
01:16:18 “will beat themselves in grief,
01:16:20 “and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven
01:16:25 “with power and great glory.
01:16:30 “And he will send out his angels
01:16:32 “with a great trumpet sound,
01:16:36 “[now note the following]
01:16:38 “and they will gather his chosen ones
01:16:41 “together from the four winds,
01:16:44 “from one extremity of the heavens
01:16:48 to the other extremity.”
01:16:52 Now, do you see the point?
01:16:55 We understand now
01:16:57 that all of Christ’s anointed brothers
01:17:01 will be in heaven with him
01:17:04 before Armageddon starts.
01:17:08 That’s the understanding that we have today.
01:17:12 And this is exciting!
01:17:14 We think so because of a few reasons,
01:17:18 and here are a few.
01:17:20 A few of the other sheep
01:17:23 have expressed a concern on this subject.
01:17:27 They have said: “Does this
01:17:30 “new understanding mean
01:17:32 “that we will lose all the anointed Christians,
01:17:37 “including the Governing Body
01:17:40 “just when we need them
01:17:43 “the most?
01:17:46 “Will we feel abandoned
01:17:49 in our time of need?”
01:17:51 Well, let me reassure you
01:17:54 that you will not be abandoned.
01:17:57 And that’s what this talk is all about.
01:18:01 You need not think that you will be abandoned
01:18:05 because of the anointed
01:18:08 not being in your midst any longer.
01:18:11 So we’re going to discuss three questions.
01:18:14 And here they are if you’re writing things down.
01:18:18 Number one:
01:18:20 What will not happen
01:18:22 when the last of the anointed leaves the earthly scene?
01:18:27 And number two:
01:18:31 How do we know
01:18:33 that such things will not happen?
01:18:37 What will happen?
01:18:39 So we’re going to look at these questions.
01:18:42 First, then, what will not happen?
01:18:44 Well, I’d like to tell you very briefly
01:18:48 two sad stories
01:18:51 to illustrate what will not happen.
01:18:55 Now here is sad story number one:
01:18:59 Do you remember Jehoiada?
01:19:02 He was a faithful high priest, one of the best.
01:19:05 When he died, he was given an unusual honor.
01:19:10 He was buried with the kings.
01:19:14 During his life, he protected the young King Jehoash
01:19:18 and helped him to be a good king
01:19:21 who stayed faithful to Jehovah.
01:19:24 But when old Jehoiada died,
01:19:29 the young king soon went bad.
01:19:32 He listened to wicked princes,
01:19:35 and he turned away from Jehovah.
01:19:39 That’s sad story number one.
01:19:43 On its heels, we have sad story number two:
01:19:49 You remember that the apostle John took great joy
01:19:53 in his spiritual children.
01:19:55 He was a good influence on them.
01:19:58 He helped many Christians to remain faithful.
01:20:02 But what happened when John died?
01:20:06 Well, he was
01:20:08 the sole surviving apostle,
01:20:11 the last restraint against apostasy.
01:20:15 So after John passed off the scene,
01:20:19 it was not long
01:20:23 before something happened.
01:20:27 What was it?
01:20:29 What happened when John died?
01:20:33 Well, the last restraint against apostasy
01:20:40 —he was the last restraint, and now he’s gone.
01:20:46 So after John passed off this earthly scene,
01:20:51 it was not long before apostasy
01:20:55 spread like wildfire.
01:20:59 And within a few decades,
01:21:01 the Christian congregation went off into captivity
01:21:05 to Babylon the Great
01:21:07 —the world empire of false religion.
01:21:12 Now, why mention
01:21:15 those sad stories?
01:21:18 Now, here’s the reason:
01:21:21 Some may wonder
01:21:25 (in our midst today in the Christian congregation):
01:21:33 ‘What’s going to happen when all the anointed
01:21:37 ‘are taken to heaven?
01:21:40 ‘Will the great crowd be left
01:21:42 ‘in the lurch?
01:21:45 ‘Will they
01:21:47 ‘stray into some kind of trouble,
01:21:51 maybe even apostasy?’
01:21:54 Well, what do you think?
01:21:58 Have you heard any signs of that already?
01:22:04 Well, here’s the answer: No.
01:22:08 They’re not going to stray into apostasy
01:22:12 —absolutely not.
01:22:15 Those Bible accounts actually
01:22:17 teach us what will not happen.
01:22:22 And that brings us to the second question:
01:22:25 How do we know
01:22:28 that such things will not happen?
01:22:32 The answer has a lot to do
01:22:35 with when we live.
01:22:40 We do not live in ancient Israel.
01:22:47 I don’t see anyone dressed like
01:22:50 an Israelite.
01:22:54 None of you brothers wear skirts.
01:22:58 Oh, there’s one! No, there’s none.
01:23:03 So no,
01:23:06 we don’t live in ancient Israel.
01:23:09 Well, now you may wonder, ‘Why does that matter?’
01:23:12 Because that nation was heading
01:23:14 for trouble from its early days.
01:23:19 At Deuteronomy 31:29,
01:23:24 Moses uttered
01:23:26 this inspired prophecy
01:23:28 about those rebellious people.
01:23:31 This is how it reads:
01:23:34 “I well know that after my death
01:23:37 “you will surely act wickedly
01:23:39 “and turn aside from the way
01:23:41 about which I have commanded you.”
01:23:44 Now, Moses’ words came true
01:23:47 many times, not just once.
01:23:49 Finally, Jehovah had to cast off those wicked people.
01:23:53 So when King Jehoash went bad,
01:23:57 he was just acting like many other
01:24:00 kings of Judah and Israel.
01:24:03 Today things are different among God’s people.
01:24:07 Keep in mind, we do not live at the end
01:24:10 of the first century C.E.
01:24:13 Now, why does that matter?
01:24:17 Remember in Matthew 13
01:24:19 in his illustration of the wheat and the weeds,
01:24:24 Jesus had foretold that a great apostasy would take place.
01:24:28 In 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,
01:24:31 Paul confirmed that Jesus’ prophecy was already beginning
01:24:35 to come true in the first century.
01:24:39 Peter and John verified the same in their writings.
01:24:43 In the second century C.E.,
01:24:47 the Christian congregation
01:24:49 was corrupted and went off into spiritual captivity
01:24:52 to Babylon the Great.
01:24:55 So Jesus’ inspired prophecy
01:24:58 was fulfilled; it came true.
01:25:02 However, today, things are very different
01:25:05 among God’s people—much different.
01:25:08 At what time are we living?
01:25:12 Well, we said, “Not back then.”
01:25:15 Well, you know the answer to that.
01:25:17 We’re blessed to be living in a special time period.
01:25:23 And this began as far back as 1914.
01:25:27 It’s more than just “the last days”
01:25:30 of this old system of things.
01:25:35 Well, why is that?
01:25:38 Notice what the Bible says—Acts 3:21.
01:25:43 It says it’s also called
01:25:45 “the times of restoration of all things.”
01:25:50 Now, let the word “restoration” linger in your mind.
01:25:55 Why does that matter?
01:25:58 We’re living in “the times of restoration of all things”
01:26:02 because pure worship has been restored.
01:26:07 We’re bathing in it.
01:26:09 And the worship of Jehovah will never
01:26:13 be corrupted ever  again
01:26:17 for all eternity.
01:26:20 Now that is something to swallow
01:26:24 that’s tasty indeed.
01:26:27 Now let’s read Isaiah 54:17 together.
01:26:32 Jehovah made this long-range prophecy through Isaiah.
01:26:37 Now, this is what it says:
01:26:40 “‘No weapon formed against you will have any success,
01:26:43 “‘and you will condemn any tongue that rises up
01:26:46 “‘against you in the judgment.
01:26:48 “‘This is the heritage
01:26:51 “‘of the servants of Jehovah,
01:26:53 “and their righteousness is from me,’
01:26:56 declares Jehovah.”
01:26:58 Now, think about that, please.
01:27:01 “No weapon
01:27:04 “formed against you
01:27:06 will have any success.”
01:27:11 The prophecy says that this is
01:27:13 our “heritage.”
01:27:15 Those inspired words are being fulfilled
01:27:18 now—today.
01:27:21 Nothing can take that away,
01:27:24 not even “the god of this system things,”
01:27:28 Satan himself.
01:27:31 Now, remember our second question:
01:27:34 How do we know
01:27:37 that when the anointed are taken to heaven,
01:27:39 the great crowd won’t drift away into trouble?
01:27:43 How do we know
01:27:45 that they won’t rebel
01:27:47 the way that Jehoash did
01:27:50 when Jehoiada died
01:27:53 or drift off into apostasy
01:27:55 the way the second-century Christians did
01:27:58 after the last of the apostles,
01:28:00 John, died off?
01:28:04 Well, we know
01:28:08 it’s just a matter of turning the page.
01:28:15 And the answer is
01:28:20 because we do not live in ancient Israel
01:28:24 and we do not live
01:28:26 in the second century C.E.
01:28:30 We live in a wonderful time
01:28:33 of—what?—
01:28:35 restoration
01:28:40 when Jehovah has guaranteed us
01:28:43 that ‘no weapon formed against us will succeed.’
01:28:48 Now, our third question:
01:28:50 What will happen when the anointed are taken to heaven?
01:28:54 Well, try to imagine that time.
01:28:58 I’ll give you a second. It’s over.
01:29:01 The great tribulation is underway.
01:29:04 Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, is destroyed first.
01:29:09 Think of it!
01:29:10 Events that God’s organization
01:29:13 has prepared us for over many decades
01:29:18 are happening before our eyes.
01:29:21 Then comes something else
01:29:24 we have been told to expect.
01:29:27 What’s that?
01:29:29 Some time during the great tribulation
01:29:32 and before the war of Armageddon,
01:29:35 the remaining ones of Christ’s anointed are taken to heaven.
01:29:39 What do you think will happen next?
01:29:44 Will the great crowd wander about lost and confused
01:29:49 like sheep without a shepherd?
01:29:51 Of course not.
01:29:53 Remember, Jesus is the Shepherd.
01:29:58 He will never fail to do his job.
01:30:03 Keep in mind that the anointed
01:30:05 are not the head of our organization.
01:30:11 Jesus is.
01:30:15 And we hope all parents today raising children
01:30:19 will teach them that fact.
01:30:23 With Jehovah’s own Son in charge,
01:30:26 Christ’s followers here on earth will have nothing to fear.
01:30:29 Of course, we do not know every detail
01:30:33 about how Christ will lead his people at that time.
01:30:36 But there are some Bible examples
01:30:39 that may reassure us.
01:30:43 For instance, when Moses died before Israel entered the Promised Land,
01:30:46 what happened to God’s people?
01:30:49 Well, without that faithful man,
01:30:53 were they left in the lurch?
01:30:56 The answer is no, not at all.
01:30:58 As long as they were Jehovah’s people,
01:31:02 Jehovah provided for them.
01:31:04 And he provided richly for them.
01:31:06 They had an abundance.
01:31:09 Before Moses died,
01:31:11 Jehovah told him to commission Joshua to lead the people.
01:31:16 Moses had been training Joshua for decades.
01:31:19 In addition, there were many other capable men taking the lead
01:31:23 —‘chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and even tens.’
01:31:26 God’s people were well cared for.
01:31:31 Thank God for Moses and Joshua.
01:31:35 Another example is that of Elijah.
01:31:38 He had been taking the lead in pure worship
01:31:41 among the Israelites for decades.
01:31:43 But the time came for Jehovah to transfer him
01:31:46 to a different assignment down south in Judah.
01:31:50 Were faithful people in the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel left in the lurch?
01:31:55 Far from it.
01:31:57 Elijah had been training
01:32:00 Elisha for years.
01:32:02 Then there were also “the sons of the prophets”
01:32:05 evidently organized into schools
01:32:08 of some kind; we don’t know.
01:32:10 So there were many faithful men
01:32:12 helping to lead God’s people.
01:32:16 Jehovah’s purpose kept advancing, and he cared for his faithful people.
01:32:20 Now, with those examples in mind, what do you think
01:32:23 will happen when the anointed are taken to heaven?
01:32:27 Well, we don’t need to wonder.
01:32:32 Open your Bibles or iPads, and look
01:32:35 at Hebrews 13:5b.
01:32:40 It says: “For he has said: ‘I will never leave you,
01:32:43 and I will never abandon you.’”
01:32:47 That tells us the simple, reassuring truth
01:32:51 that Jehovah will “never abandon” his faithful ones.
01:32:56 Like Moses and Elijah, faithful anointed ones
01:33:00 who take the lead today understand the importance
01:33:03 of training others.
01:33:05 That’s ongoing.
01:33:07 The Governing Body has been training men
01:33:09 of the other sheep to take the lead for many decades now.
01:33:13 We’re familiar with the many schools
01:33:15 to train elders and missionaries and traveling overseers
01:33:18 and branch personnel.
01:33:21 In addition to that, the Governing Body has personally been training helpers
01:33:25 to the various committees of the Governing Body.
01:33:28 These faithful men are right now
01:33:31 carrying a very heavy load of responsibility.
01:33:34 Believe me,
01:33:36 as a member of the Governing Body,
01:33:38 I can say for the rest of us
01:33:41 that we need the helpers
01:33:43 that Jehovah has given us.
01:33:46 We pray for them every day.
01:33:48 And they’re well-prepared to continue in this work,
01:33:52 caring for Christ’s sheep
01:33:54 under the direction of Jesus himself, the head of the congregation.
01:33:59 Now, what is the point?
01:34:00 Simply this:
01:34:02 When the anointed are taken to heaven near the very end
01:34:05 of the great tribulation but before Armageddon,
01:34:09 there will be no interruption of pure worship here on the earth.
01:34:13 Pure worship will keep right on going.
01:34:16 So thank
01:34:20 Jehovah for the leadership of Jesus Christ.
01:34:24 None of God’s worshippers in heaven
01:34:27 or on earth will miss a beat.
01:34:32 Yes, there will be an attack from Gog of Magog,
01:34:35 but it will not get very far.
01:34:37 It’s going to fail.
01:34:38 It will not stop the great crowd from worshipping Jehovah
01:34:41 and looking to him to rescue them.
01:34:44 And what a Rescuer he will prove to be!
01:34:49 Now, how do we answer the third question?
01:34:51 Well, we partly know what will happen
01:34:54 to the great crowd when the anointed are taken to heaven,
01:34:57 but that may still leave us wondering:
01:35:00 ‘What about the anointed?
01:35:02 ‘What will they do after they depart the earthly scene?
01:35:09 We want to know.’
01:35:15 Well, the Bible answers that directly.
01:35:18 At Revelation chapter 17,
01:35:21 we are able to learn in verse 14
01:35:26 that the political elements of this world will foolishly battle with the Lamb.
01:35:30 They will lose, of course.
01:35:32 The verse says: “The Lamb will conquer them.”
01:35:36 And who will help him?
01:35:38 The verse continues: “Also, those with him
01:35:41 who are called and chosen and faithful will do so.”
01:35:45 Now, who are called, chosen, and faithful?
01:35:48 At that time, it will be  the resurrected anointed.
01:35:52 So when the anointed are called to heaven,
01:35:54 one of the first assignments is to fight.
01:35:58 Yay!
01:36:02 Now, that’s interesting.
01:36:05 Some of us were fighters
01:36:07 before we became true Christians.
01:36:10 Some even served in various branches of the military
01:36:16 —didn’t we, Brother Morris?
01:36:25 Some were green berets but not Brother Morris.
01:36:33 But then we became Christians.
01:36:35 We learned “the way of peace,” and we let go of such warfare.
01:36:39 Figuratively speaking, we pulled the pin
01:36:42 on our last hand-grenade
01:36:45 and tossed it into the air,
01:36:48 killing no one or nothing
01:36:51 —just a loud kaboom.
01:36:56 But in heaven, we will serve along with Christ and his holy angels,
01:37:00 waging the final war against God’s enemies.
01:37:04 So if you’ve ever thought that you might feel left in the lurch
01:37:09 after the anointed are taken to heaven, think of this:
01:37:12 On earth, none of us Christians are allowed to fight.
01:37:15 Many of us anointed ones are too old to fight,
01:37:18 even if we were allowed to.
01:37:22 But in heaven,
01:37:24 we will be mighty spirit creatures
01:37:27 fighting alongside our Warrior-King Jesus Christ.
01:37:31 Believe me, we can and will do
01:37:36 you significantly more good in heaven
01:37:39 than we ever could as imperfect humans
01:37:43 here on this earth!
01:38:03 Well, I’m not done, but I should be.
01:38:09 As for the other sheep,
01:38:12 what will you need to do during that climactic time?
01:38:16 Simply this: hide.
01:38:19 That’s right.
01:38:20 At Isaiah 26:20, he wrote:
01:38:22 “Enter your inner rooms,
01:38:24 “and shut your doors behind you.
01:38:27 “Hide yourself for a brief moment
01:38:29 until the wrath has passed by.”
01:38:32 It will be hide-and-seek.
01:38:35 You will hide, and they will seek to find you,
01:38:38 but they will not.
01:38:41 Do you have anything to worry about?
01:38:44 You have nothing to worry about
01:38:47 —nothing at all—
01:38:50 because Jehovah will never
01:38:53 abandon you.
01:38:55 There is no justifiable reason to worry about the future.
01:39:00 Just be there, brothers and sisters, to enjoy it.
01:39:04 Remember, Jehovah loves you and he will never abandon you.
01:39:09 Please believe it.
01:39:11 You will not be disappointed.
01:39:22 Well, we said it would be a treat,
01:39:25 and it was a treat.
01:39:27 Thank you so much, Brother Herd,
01:39:30 for helping us to realize that God’s people are completely safe,
01:39:35 even as we approach the great tribulation and Armageddon.
01:39:39 But now the question is, When will those events occur?
01:39:44 Please pay close attention to Brother Anthony Morris,
01:39:47 another member of the Governing Body,
01:39:49 as he speaks to us on this subject:
01:39:52 “Why ‘Keep on the Watch’?”
01:39:56 So to answer the question,
01:39:59 Why keep on the watch?
01:40:02 there is a simple, direct answer.
01:40:04 But we have a second reason as well
01:40:08 to share during this talk.
01:40:10 Find Mark,
01:40:15 and we’re going to read
01:40:17 chapter 13.
01:40:20 And it leads to our main reason why,
01:40:24 but the context will really help us
01:40:28 in verse 32.
01:40:31 Let’s read that: “Concerning that day or the hour
01:40:36 “nobody knows,
01:40:38 “neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father.
01:40:43 “Keep looking, keep awake,
01:40:46 “for you do not know when the appointed time is.
01:40:50 “It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house
01:40:53 “and gave the authority to his slaves, to each one his work,
01:40:57 “and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch.
01:41:01 “Keep on the watch, therefore,
01:41:04 “for you do not know when the master of the house is coming,
01:41:09 “whether late in the day or at midnight
01:41:12 “or [at] dawn or early in the morning,
01:41:15 “in order that when he comes suddenly,
01:41:19 he does not find you sleeping.”
01:41:24 Now, that’s our Lord and Master
01:41:27 —very direct.
01:41:29 He’s compassionate (true) but direct.
01:41:32 And then the main reason why—verse 37:
01:41:37 “What I say to you, I say to all
01:41:41 “[so it’s being repeated to all of us listening]:
01:41:46 Keep on the watch.”
01:41:49 Very simple, very direct.
01:41:53 That’s what is expected.
01:41:55 However, and I appreciated—
01:41:57 I hadn’t heard Brother Cook’s talk
01:42:01 (knew about the details and such),
01:42:03 but he emphasized for all of us, and it’s connected here,
01:42:08 Jehovah as a God of comfort.
01:42:13 So while it’s true that we want to sometimes address directly
01:42:17 the things that Jesus has taught us,
01:42:20 it doesn’t mean that Jehovah is
01:42:23 no longer a God of comfort.
01:42:27 He wants to comfort us.
01:42:29 So this is the second reason.
01:42:31 If you’ll find Isaiah,
01:42:34 we’re going to read in chapter 48.
01:42:39 And it’s a very fine thought
01:42:42 about why keep on the watch.
01:42:45 In verse 17—very familiar to us—
01:42:48 you’ll see the point:
01:42:51 “This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser,
01:42:54 “the Holy One of Israel:
01:42:56 “‘I, Jehovah, am your God,
01:43:00 “‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,
01:43:04 the One guiding you in the way you should walk.’”
01:43:09 Now, how we appreciate the footnote
01:43:13 that adds depth to what Jehovah is saying here:
01:43:18 “Or ‘for your own good’”!
01:43:22 Isn’t that priceless?
01:43:24 Why keep on the watch?
01:43:29 It’s for our own good.
01:43:31 It really is.
01:43:34 And that’s the point Jesus and Jehovah want us to take away.
01:43:39 We’re trying to address that with this talk
01:43:42 because some of you have been serving Jehovah
01:43:45 for a long time.
01:43:48 And I’m not going to stare at anybody
01:43:50 because I know different ones,
01:43:52 and it’s just amazing how Jehovah
01:43:57 has been there for you all these years.
01:44:01 But you’re only human.
01:44:03 And we’ll address some concerns that some raise.
01:44:07 And I just want to have you think about this here
01:44:11 —a personal experience.
01:44:13 Many years ago, my sons, Jesse and Paul,
01:44:18 were in the early years of school
01:44:21 —elementary school.
01:44:24 And back at the time— I haven’t heard it a lot lately,
01:44:27 but from time to time, this would come up at a social gathering.
01:44:32 Now, mind you, they’re
01:44:33 in second grade and first grade,
01:44:37 but these boys were thinkers.
01:44:40 So they’d listen, and they appreciated all these older ones.
01:44:44 We had a number of them in Rhode Island
01:44:47 —longtime servants of Jehovah God.
01:44:50 However, from time to time—this statement—
01:44:53 they’d be looking at my sons and say:
01:44:56 “Oh, you’ll never graduate in this system.
01:45:01 It’s not going to happen.”
01:45:03 So, you know, I’m at their house; they just fed us.
01:45:09 Lord, help me. What am I going to do here?
01:45:12 But this would come up from time to time, at least during those years.
01:45:17 And maybe it was post-1975.
01:45:19 I don’t know.
01:45:21 But they’d make these statements.
01:45:23 And I’m going to give you a big confession
01:45:25 because, you know, this one comes clear to mind.
01:45:29 Driving back from the gathering,
01:45:32 Jesse and Paul are, you know, thinking and they’re troubled.
01:45:37 They’re puzzled. What is this about?
01:45:39 Because, you know, they had goals.
01:45:41 “What are we going to do?”
01:45:43 And they’re thinking of the things in the future for them
01:45:46 as they’re growing in their love for Jehovah.
01:45:51 “Is that true, Dad?”
01:45:53 And so I’d say, “Look . . .”
01:45:55 And let me tell you, these people saying these things
01:45:57 were longtime servants—experienced people.
01:46:01 If any of you are guilty, God loves you. He forgives you.
01:46:05 If you did that back then, you didn’t help anybody.
01:46:11 But I’m going to give you a big confession.
01:46:14 So that one particular night, we’re driving back
01:46:17 —it was a little distance from where we were—
01:46:19 and they brought that up.
01:46:21 They’re sitting in the back seat, and we’re having this conversation.
01:46:24 And I told them—I said: “Look, you boys remember,
01:46:30 “you got to keep on the watch.
01:46:34 This thing could go on, and be ready for it to go to 2020.”
01:46:40 Honest.
01:46:42 I mean, we’re talking almost 40 years —almost 40 years.
01:46:47 I felt pretty safe with that.
01:46:53 But you know what year this is.
01:46:55 What are you going to do?
01:46:58 But at least I’m happy to say
01:47:01 that they and my wife and their wives
01:47:06 are all still keeping on the watch.
01:47:08 We have been and plan to continue
01:47:12 to keep on the watch.
01:47:15 Now, this is just something to address
01:47:18 —the feelings that some have.
01:47:21 And these are beautiful friends
01:47:24 —different ones worshipping Jehovah for many decades.
01:47:29 And we’re only human.
01:47:32 It’s the truth,
01:47:34 but we’re only human.
01:47:37 So one brother wrote,
01:47:40 and I appreciated his sincerity.
01:47:42 He said:
01:47:45 “During the annual meeting of 2019,
01:47:47 “the Ramapo project was announced.
01:47:51 “And if I remember right,
01:47:53 “it was stated that the project would be complete in a few years.
01:47:59 “With recent Watchtower  articles telling us
01:48:01 “that we are in ‘the last of “the last days”’
01:48:06 “[beautiful expression, but words are powerful],
01:48:10 “it seemed a little disappointing
01:48:13 that this may push Armageddon off a few years.”
01:48:18 This was his sincere concern—really.
01:48:22 And you know he’s not alone.
01:48:26 They’re only human.
01:48:28 Well, how should we respond?
01:48:31 A brother wrote that in.
01:48:33 Well, remember, Jehovah is a God of comfort.
01:48:38 You want to go direct.
01:48:40 It’s what we addressed there with what Jesus told us.
01:48:43 But how can we comfort him too?
01:48:48 Bring the truth as it is, and be straight with it.
01:48:56 The Governing Body wants all of you to know
01:48:59 (including those that will see it later)
01:49:02 that we are determined to remain active
01:49:06 and to faithfully deliver spiritual food
01:49:10 at the right time.
01:49:13 We are also looking beyond the last days.
01:49:18 You’re getting that message.
01:49:20 Let me expound on that thought:
01:49:23 looking beyond the last days.
01:49:26 This is a quote from the Proclaimers  book.
01:49:31 I treasured it when the book came out,
01:49:33 and a lot of work went into that publication.
01:49:37 But there, referring to God’s people, it stated—
01:49:43 You know, there was a lot of international construction
01:49:45 going on at the time too, if you were in the truth then.
01:49:48 I’m quoting it now: “With the help of Jehovah’s spirit,
01:49:53 “they [God’s people] want to give the greatest witness possible
01:49:57 “during the time that remains before Armageddon.
01:50:01 “They are convinced
01:50:03 “that God’s new world is very close at hand,
01:50:07 “and they have faith
01:50:09 “that they will survive as an organized people
01:50:13 “into that new world, under the rule
01:50:16 of God’s Messianic Kingdom.”
01:50:18 Now, please note the rest of this quote:
01:50:24 “It is also their hope that perhaps
01:50:28 “[key word]
01:50:30 “many of the fine facilities that they have built
01:50:33 “and dedicated to Jehovah
01:50:35 “will continue to be used after Armageddon
01:50:39 “as centers from which knowledge of the only true God
01:50:43 can be diffused until it truly fills the earth.”
01:50:48 Beautiful thought.
01:50:50 It’s right there—still valid.
01:50:54 So in harmony with what the faithful slave said then,
01:50:59 the faithful slave now says
01:51:02 that many of the projects that are being worked on now
01:51:06 —like Ramapo, the Good News According to Jesus  video series—
01:51:11 may or perhaps
01:51:17 will carry over into the new world
01:51:20 to assist the great crowd with the work ahead
01:51:24 and perhaps
01:51:27 include resurrected ones.
01:51:30 That’s comforting.
01:51:32 You have to let that sink in.
01:51:36 Now we want to conclude
01:51:39 with expressions from two friends of mine
01:51:43 —longtime hardworking supporters
01:51:47 of the faithful slave for decades.
01:51:51 I love these men, and we’ll keep it anonymous.
01:51:54 But I asked them to write their personal feelings
01:51:59 because, you know, they’ve been supporting the slave for all these decades.
01:52:05 How have they benefited
01:52:08 from keeping on the watch?
01:52:11 So here’s what the first one said:
01:52:16 “I come from a long line of people
01:52:19 “who believed in keeping in expectation of the end.
01:52:23 “My mother died just last year,
01:52:27 “and she always felt that the end was close at hand.
01:52:31 “She just knew that she would live to see it,
01:52:35 “but she didn’t.
01:52:38 “She had first learned the truth from her mother-in-law, my grandmother,
01:52:42 “an anointed Christian who often told me
01:52:44 “that she hoped to see the end come in her lifetime.
01:52:48 “She didn’t.
01:52:51 “She had learned the truth from her mother, who died when I was a teenager
01:52:55 “and firmly believed she would see the end in her lifetime.
01:52:59 “She didn’t.
01:53:01 “And she, my great-grandmother,
01:53:03 “had learned the truth from her mother-in-law
01:53:05 “who died long before I was born
01:53:08 “and surely felt the same way about seeing the end.
01:53:12 “She didn’t.
01:53:14 “And here I am now on my seventh decade of life,
01:53:18 “firmly believing that I will see the end very soon.
01:53:24 “So, what does that mean?
01:53:27 “That I’m just another one in a long line of delusional people?
01:53:33 “I don’t think so for two reasons.
01:53:37 “One, the evidence that the end is near keeps growing.
01:53:42 “I’ve seen signs of the end that even my mother never saw,
01:53:46 “such as the recent pandemic.
01:53:48 “Sometimes I compare myself to a man living in Judea
01:53:52 “around the year 608 B.C.E.
01:53:55 “Such a man might have come from a long line of faithful people
01:54:00 “who had listened to the prophets and thought that the end was near.
01:54:05 “Over a century earlier,
01:54:08 “hearing these things
01:54:10 “(and maybe his great-grandparents might have heard Isaiah speak)
01:54:14 “led them to conclude that Jerusalem’s end was near.
01:54:19 “Should that man decide that his family had been deluded
01:54:24 “just because they hadn’t seen the destruction of Jerusalem?
01:54:28 “No.
01:54:30 Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E.”
01:54:34 So, see, he’s living in 608 B.C.E. having these concerns.
01:54:39 Months later, it happens.
01:54:43 “But more importantly, that man would know
01:54:46 “that his faithful family were good people who lived good lives.
01:54:50 “They loved Jehovah, and they saw the truth of Isaiah’s words.
01:54:56 “God teaches us to benefit ourselves.
01:55:01 “And that’s the second reason why I don’t feel that I’ve been deluded
01:55:06 “or that my faithful family members have been.
01:55:09 “Each one who served Jehovah led a good, productive, useful life.
01:55:14 “They were not just sitting around waiting for the end.
01:55:17 “They always had projects that kept them busy in Jehovah’s service
01:55:21 “—goals and personal study and preaching and helping others.
01:55:25 “So they were full of purpose and joy.
01:55:28 “I want the same kind of life.
01:55:31 “Also, I can hardly wait to tell my mother [this is touching]
01:55:36 “just how close the end was
01:55:39 “when she finally closed her eyes.
01:55:42 I know she will want to hear all about it.”
01:55:47 See, very touching.
01:55:49 And now the second brother relates
01:55:52 how keeping on the watch has benefited him.
01:55:56 “My mom raised my brother and me in the truth.
01:55:59 “She often expressed to us her confidence
01:56:02 “that the end is just around the corner.
01:56:06 “She didn’t just say it, but she lived it.
01:56:09 “She devoted herself to the ministry
01:56:12 “so that she could help others to serve Jehovah
01:56:15 “while there is still time.
01:56:17 “She kept in expectation of the end,
01:56:20 “doing so year after year
01:56:23 “until she died.
01:56:25 “Now I’m approaching the age of my mother when she died.
01:56:30 “I’ve been keeping on the watch for over 50 years now.
01:56:33 “Am I bitter because the end has not yet come?
01:56:36 “No, not at all.
01:56:40 “How could I be?
01:56:42 “I’ve lived a full and satisfying life
01:56:44 “by living according to Jehovah’s standards.
01:56:47 “Why would I want to live any other way?
01:56:51 “What has helped me to keep positive while waiting for the end to come?
01:56:56 “From time to time, I reflect on these few things [and here they are]:
01:57:00 “My dedication is unconditional and unending.
01:57:05 “I did not dedicate myself to Jehovah
01:57:08 “on the condition that he brings the end within my lifetime
01:57:12 “or even on the condition that he gives me a reward.
01:57:15 “I dedicated myself to him forever.
01:57:20 “And next, I must keep the big picture in mind.
01:57:24 “I don’t want to make the mistake of focusing
01:57:27 “only on what the end will mean for me
01:57:31 “—the prospect of surviving into the new world.
01:57:35 “Rather, I must focus on something far more important
01:57:39 “—what the end will mean for Jehovah
01:57:42 “and the sanctification of his name.
01:57:45 “Knowing how important that is to him,
01:57:48 “I can be sure that it will happen
01:57:52 in his due time.”
01:57:54 And then finally:
01:57:56 “Meanwhile, I must endure to the end.
01:58:00 “That means to the end of this system or to the end of my life,
01:58:04 “whichever comes first.
01:58:06 “Either way, the older I get, the closer I am to the end.
01:58:12 “What if, like my mom, I don’t live to see it?
01:58:15 “No worries.
01:58:19 “The moment I close my eyes in death,
01:58:23 “my next conscious thought will be
01:58:25 “opening my eyes in the new world.
01:58:29 “Then it really won’t matter
01:58:32 whether I live to see the end or not.”
01:58:36 Beautiful expressions
01:58:39 of two beautiful spiritual men.
01:58:42 So the question to conclude is,
01:58:46 Will this be the last annual meeting
01:58:52 before the great tribulation?
01:58:56 Nobody raised their hand.
01:58:59 We don’t know.
01:59:01 But what we do know
01:59:04 is that Jehovah and Jesus want us
01:59:07 to keep on the watch.
01:59:12 And it’s for our own good to do so.
01:59:23 Thank you so much, Brother Morris,
01:59:26 for that very stirring, very encouraging talk.
01:59:29 Well, would you agree, brothers and sisters,
01:59:32 that we have not been disappointed
01:59:34 with our banquet of spiritual food today?
01:59:36 How do you feel?
01:59:45 We began our program by being reminded that Jehovah,
01:59:49 by means of “the faithful and discreet slave,”
01:59:51 is providing what we need exactly at the right time.
01:59:56 And what an abundance of spiritual food we have!
02:00:01 Just think of the variety that we discussed
02:00:04 in our annual meeting today
02:00:06 —our new publication Enjoy Life Forever!,
02:00:10 a brand new Caleb and Sophia epic video,
02:00:14 the wonderful Scriptural talks,
02:00:16 the direction that we received regarding the COVID-19 pandemic,
02:00:20 The Good News According to Jesus video project,
02:00:24 as well as the wonderful, upbuilding spiritual songs.
02:00:28 And that’s just a fraction
02:00:31 of the spiritual food that we’re receiving at this time.
02:00:34 Certainly, Jehovah,
02:00:36 by means of “the faithful and discreet slave,”
02:00:39 keeps giving all these forms of spiritual food
02:00:44 just at the right time.
02:00:46 Well, the events of the past two years
02:00:50 have been historic,
02:00:52 and they truly have been unprecedented.
02:00:57 They indicate that we are close
02:01:00 to the outbreak of the great tribulation.
02:01:03 How vital it is, brothers,
02:01:06 that we continue to recognize
02:01:08 Jehovah’s channel for receiving spiritual food!
02:01:13 The November 15, 2013, issue of The Watchtower
02:01:19 mentioned key points for elders in particular to keep in mind
02:01:23 as we prepare to face the attack
02:01:26 of that coalition of nations
02:01:29 that the Bible calls Gog of Magog.
02:01:33 Now I’m going to quote the article; this is what it stated.
02:01:36 This is the quote: “At that time,
02:01:39 “life-saving direction that we receive from Jehovah’s organization
02:01:44 “may not appear practical from a human standpoint.
02:01:50 “All of us must be ready to obey
02:01:53 “any instructions we may receive,
02:01:55 “whether these appear sound
02:01:57 “from a strategic or human standpoint or not. . . .
02:02:03 “Now is the time
02:02:05 “for any who may be putting their trust in secular education,
02:02:10 “material things,
02:02:12 “or human institutions
02:02:15 to adjust their thinking.”
02:02:19 Very sober words
02:02:21 that apply so well at this particular moment.
02:02:26 So, dear brothers and sisters, do you know what time it is?
02:02:30 There has never been a more important time
02:02:33 to stay alert spiritually
02:02:36 and to respond quickly
02:02:39 to Jehovah’s direction.
02:02:41 Jehovah has led us safely to this moment.
02:02:45 He has given us everything that we need,
02:02:48 and we know he’s going to continue to do so
02:02:51 —just as our 2022 yeartext
02:02:54 found at Psalm 34:10 states:
02:02:57 “Those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.”
02:03:03 So, dear brothers and sisters,
02:03:05 be determined
02:03:07 to continue to follow our Leader, Jesus Christ,
02:03:12 and the channel that he is using today
02:03:15 because if we do,
02:03:17 we will have everything that we need
02:03:20 and right on time.
02:03:29 Well, with that we conclude another spiritual feast
02:03:33 in conjunction with the annual meeting
02:03:35 of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.
02:03:39 Wasn’t that a powerful program?
02:03:42 And how reassuring to review the many ways
02:03:46 Jehovah has strengthened us, energized us,
02:03:49 and comforted us over the last year!
02:03:52 This annual meeting left us with no doubt
02:03:56 that despite the challenges
02:03:58 our brothers and sisters have had to endure
02:04:00 in the face of persecution,
02:04:02 natural disasters,
02:04:04 and the ongoing effects of the pandemic,
02:04:08 Jehovah continues to bless his people.
02:04:12 His organization is on the move as never before.
02:04:17 Let’s conclude our program with a video postcard
02:04:21 that takes us to the beautiful island nation of Jamaica.
02:04:26 Jamaica is the third-largest island in the Caribbean Sea,
02:04:30 located about 100 miles,
02:04:33 or 160 kilometers,
02:04:35 west of Haiti.
02:04:37 The golden beaches
02:04:39 and beautiful coral reefs that ring the island
02:04:42 draw more than four million visitors each year.
02:04:46 The country’s main crops include bananas,
02:04:49 sugarcane,
02:04:51 and world-famous Jamaican blue mountain coffee,
02:04:55 which is grown high on the steep slopes of the Blue Mountains.
02:04:59 Jamaica is also known for its jerk cuisine,
02:05:03 which features meats such as chicken, pork, or goat
02:05:07 rubbed with spices and cooked over a fire
02:05:11 to give the meat a distinctive smoky flavor.
02:05:15 The good news first reached Jamaica in 1897.
02:05:20 Brother Russell even gave a talk
02:05:22 in the capital city of Kingston back in 1913.
02:05:28 Today, there are more than 11,360 publishers
02:05:33 preaching in more than 165 congregations
02:05:37 and groups.
02:05:39 The national language of Jamaica is English,
02:05:43 but two remote translation offices
02:05:45 help support the preaching in Jamaican Creole
02:05:48 and Jamaican Sign Language.
02:05:51 During the pandemic
02:05:53 when it became necessary to hold meetings
02:05:55 by videoconference,
02:05:58 our Jamaican brothers had to deal with a special challenge
02:06:02 —the high price of Internet access.
02:06:06 The cost of data to connect to just one meeting
02:06:09 was twice the price of taking a taxi to the Kingdom Hall.
02:06:14 So it was far more expensive to attend a meeting virtually
02:06:18 than it was to attend in person.
02:06:20 Our Jamaican brothers and sisters
02:06:22 generously have been sharing their electronic devices
02:06:26 and helping one another with the cost of data
02:06:29 so that everyone can access the meetings
02:06:33 and enjoy good association.
02:06:35 Some who benefited from these provisions
02:06:38 are in the Central Sign Language Congregation in Mandeville.
02:06:43 The congregation has been able to meet together by videoconferencing
02:06:47 with two other Jamaican Sign Language groups,
02:06:50 providing deaf publishers on the island
02:06:52 with more opportunities for association
02:06:55 during the pandemic.
02:06:58 The hardworking publishers
02:07:00 in the Central Sign Language Congregation
02:07:02 send you their love and greetings.
02:07:06 And please remember, dear brothers and sisters,
02:07:09 that we love you all very much.
02:07:12 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
02:07:15 this is JW Broadcasting!
