00:00:01 Welcome!
00:00:03 Here are a few highlights of this month’s program.
00:00:06 During the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:00:08 some of Jehovah’s people suffered
00:00:11 heartbreaking losses.
00:00:13 We’ll see how Jehovah’s love triumphed over tragedy.
00:00:18 We cherish the rich diversity of our global brotherhood.
00:00:22 But could our local culture
00:00:24 somehow influence our thinking
00:00:27 and undermine our precious unity?
00:00:30 And our new music video reminds us that unity
00:00:34 not only makes us joyful
00:00:36 but it makes us strong.
00:00:39 This is JW Broadcasting® for May 2022!
00:01:02 The theme of this year’s regional convention
00:01:05 is “Pursue Peace!”
00:01:08 Here’s a preview of the program.
00:01:12 Peace is often defined
00:01:15 as the absence of conflict.
00:01:18 But peace involves much more.
00:01:21 The truth is, we each face trials
00:01:24 that can rob us of peace:
00:01:27 illness,
00:01:29 economic problems,
00:01:33 our own weaknesses,
00:01:37 damaged relationships.
00:01:43 What threatens your peace?
00:01:50 At the 2022 “Pursue Peace”! Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:54 you will discover how you can find
00:01:56 real, lasting peace in your life right now!
00:02:10 Our convention theme is so timely.
00:02:13 The world is full of conflict and anguish.
00:02:18 People long for peace, and they long for unity,
00:02:23 which is the focus of this month’s broadcast.
00:02:26 Our theme is
00:02:28 “Stand Together as One United People.”
00:02:33 Let me begin with a question:
00:02:36 Where do you keep your wallet?
00:02:39 If you’re out in public,
00:02:41 you brothers likely keep it in your pocket (maybe a front pocket)
00:02:45 so that it doesn’t get lost or stolen.
00:02:49 You sisters might carry your wallet in a purse, or handbag,
00:02:53 which you keep close by your side.
00:02:56 You guard your wallet because you know that if you get careless,
00:03:01 a thief might steal it and you might never see
00:03:05 your wallet or its contents again.
00:03:09 It is similar with the precious unity
00:03:13 we enjoy as Jehovah’s people.
00:03:16 We need to guard it and protect it,
00:03:19 or else someone might steal it.
00:03:22 Make no mistake,
00:03:24 the Devil is looking for an opportunity
00:03:27 to steal our unity from us.
00:03:30 Think about how unique our unity is.
00:03:34 Unlike other religious organizations,
00:03:37 we’re not divided into subdenominations.
00:03:40 We don’t have Northern Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:03:43 Orthodox Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:03:45 or Reformed Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:48 As the apostle Paul expressed it,
00:03:51 we are “united in the same mind
00:03:55 and in the same line of thought.”
00:03:59 We are also united internationally.
00:04:02 We don’t fight against one another in the wars that divide nations.
00:04:06 And we are united racially.
00:04:09 Many times, Witnesses have risked their lives
00:04:13 to protect their fellow Christians of another race who were being threatened
00:04:18 or persecuted because of their racial or ethnic background.
00:04:23 We are also united in our purpose.
00:04:26 For example, no matter where we live,
00:04:28 we all preach the same good news
00:04:33 and we all receive the same weekly spiritual instruction.
00:04:38 Can you find this unity out in the world?
00:04:42 Look around.
00:04:44 People are divided.
00:04:46 Nations attack each other.
00:04:48 And within nations, political parties fight one another.
00:04:52 Corporations compete with and destroy each other,
00:04:56 and citizens commit racially
00:04:59 or ethnically motivated hate crimes
00:05:02 against each other.
00:05:04 What a contrast that is
00:05:07 with Jehovah’s worshippers!
00:05:09 We stand together
00:05:12 as one united people.
00:05:16 Why, though, do we each need to guard
00:05:20 and protect our unity?
00:05:22 Can’t we safely assume that Jehovah will protect it
00:05:26 and that he will see to it that our unity is preserved?
00:05:30 Not entirely.
00:05:33 Guarding the unity of God’s people is a responsibility
00:05:37 that Jehovah has given each one of us.
00:05:40 We must do our part to ensure
00:05:43 that we stand together as one united people.
00:05:48 What will happen if we don’t?
00:05:51 Divisions will occur among us
00:05:54 —divisions that resemble what we see in the world.
00:05:58 It happened in the first-century congregation in Corinth.
00:06:02 To them, Paul wrote
00:06:05 at 1 Corinthians 1:11:
00:06:09 “There are dissensions among you.”
00:06:14 What kind of “dissensions”?
00:06:16 Some said, ‘I belong to Peter’;
00:06:19 others said, ‘I belong to Paul’;
00:06:22 and still others said, ‘I belong to Apollos.’
00:06:26 Paul felt compelled to ask
00:06:29 at 1 Corinthians 1:13:
00:06:34 “Is the Christ divided?”
00:06:38 What a reproach on Jehovah’s name and on true worship!
00:06:42 By failing to guard their unity,
00:06:45 those early disciples were making Christianity
00:06:48 look like just another religion.
00:06:51 Could something like that happen in a congregation today?
00:06:55 It could happen
00:06:57 if individuals cared more about their own personal preferences,
00:07:02 conveniences, and opinions
00:07:05 than they do about the unity of Jehovah’s people.
00:07:09 Selfishness is not “the fruitage of [Jehovah’s] spirit.”
00:07:14 Rather, it reflects “the spirit of the world.”
00:07:18 The world is aggressively promoting the view
00:07:21 that you should put yourself first,
00:07:24 but we have learned Jehovah’s view.
00:07:28 First Corinthians 10:24 tells us
00:07:32 to “keep seeking,
00:07:33 “not [our] own advantage,
00:07:35 but that of the other person.”
00:07:39 In chapter 13, verse 5,
00:07:41 Paul wrote that love “does not look for its own interests.”
00:07:46 And he states at Romans 15:3
00:07:50 that “the Christ did not please himself.”
00:07:55 Therefore, we cannot afford to care more about our privileges,
00:07:59 our pride, or our opinions
00:08:02 than we do about Christian unity.
00:08:05 If we put our own wants first,
00:08:08 then just like a man who leaves his wallet out in public
00:08:12 for a thief to steal,
00:08:14 we place the congregation’s unity
00:08:17 in plain view for Satan to snatch.
00:08:21 And there is no doubt that the Devil will seize the opportunity,
00:08:25 and the congregation will suffer.
00:08:29 We need to accept
00:08:31 our personal responsibility
00:08:33 to guard and protect our unity
00:08:37 not only as a congregation but also as field service groups,
00:08:42 families, married couples, and friends.
00:08:46 So let’s now discuss four areas
00:08:50 where we especially need
00:08:52 to guard and protect our Christian unity.
00:08:57 The first is our response to direction
00:09:01 from Jehovah’s organization.
00:09:04 When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020,
00:09:09 we all received direction,
00:09:11 including new ways to attend our meetings and carry out our ministry
00:09:16 and ways to comply with the secular authorities.
00:09:20 Did you disagree?
00:09:23 Or did you have a different idea?
00:09:25 If so, did you follow the direction anyway
00:09:29 and give it your support?
00:09:31 If you did,
00:09:34 then you contributed to our unity.
00:09:37 When we stand together
00:09:39 and unitedly follow direction
00:09:42 from Jehovah’s organization, good things happen.
00:09:47 Like what?
00:09:49 Like what happened when the first-century Christians complied
00:09:53 with the direction from the apostles and older men in Jerusalem.
00:09:58 Acts 16:4, 5 says:
00:10:03 “As they traveled on through the cities,
00:10:06 “they would deliver to them for observance the decrees
00:10:10 “that had been decided on
00:10:12 “by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.
00:10:16 “Then, indeed,
00:10:18 “the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith
00:10:22 and to increase in number day by day.”
00:10:28 Individual Christians and congregations
00:10:32 recognized and submitted to the authority
00:10:36 of the governing body at that time
00:10:38 —the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
00:10:41 Did you note the beneficial results?
00:10:44 “The congregations continued to be made firm . . .
00:10:48 and to increase.”
00:10:50 And that’s what happened when you brothers and sisters
00:10:54 followed the direction regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:10:58 We experienced significant increases
00:11:02 in meeting attendance.
00:11:04 The attendance for the 2021 Memorial
00:11:07 reached an all-time peak.
00:11:10 It is amazing
00:11:12 what Jehovah accomplishes
00:11:14 when we stand together
00:11:16 as one united people!
00:11:20 A second area in which we need to protect our unity
00:11:24 is culture.
00:11:26 Jehovah’s organization is diverse.
00:11:29 We love to be introduced
00:11:31 to different kinds of food,
00:11:33 different styles of dress, and interesting customs.
00:11:36 How wonderful!
00:11:38 But what if we started feeling that my race,
00:11:43 my tribe, my ethnicity,
00:11:46 my culture is superior?
00:11:50 Can you see how that kind of thinking would divide us?
00:11:54 To preserve our unity, we need to focus,
00:11:58 not on how we are different from one another,
00:12:01 but how we are the same.
00:12:03 We are
00:12:05 Jehovah’s Witnesses first
00:12:07 —not African, Asian,
00:12:09 North American, South American,
00:12:12 or European.
00:12:14 Our people
00:12:16 are our spiritual family
00:12:18 —our spiritual brothers and sisters.
00:12:21 Our culture is genuine Christianity.
00:12:26 When we are willing to adopt Jehovah’s thinking
00:12:30 that we learn from his Word,
00:12:32 even setting aside our own personal customs
00:12:36 or culture if necessary,
00:12:38 we stand together
00:12:41 as one united people.
00:12:44 We experience what the Bible describes
00:12:47 at Zephaniah 3:9:
00:12:52 “For then I will change the language
00:12:55 “of the peoples to a pure language,
00:12:57 “so that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah,
00:13:02 to serve him shoulder to shoulder.”
00:13:06 How wonderful!
00:13:08 A third area
00:13:10 is personality differences.
00:13:13 Growing up in this divided world,
00:13:15 we may have absorbed some of its sensitivities.
00:13:19 But Ecclesiastes 7:9 says:
00:13:24 “Do not be quick to take offense.”
00:13:28 If a fellow Christian hurts our feelings,
00:13:31 we have a special opportunity
00:13:34 and obligation
00:13:37 to show that we stand together as one united people.
00:13:41 How can we do that?
00:13:44 Colossians 3:13 says:
00:13:49 “Continue putting up with one another
00:13:52 “and forgiving one another freely
00:13:54 “even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.
00:13:59 “Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,
00:14:03 you must also do the same.”
00:14:07 Note both phrases:
00:14:09 “putting up with one another and forgiving one another.”
00:14:14 Some imperfections and slights are so small.
00:14:18 Do they really require formal forgiveness?
00:14:22 Because of our human imperfection,
00:14:25 we need to do what Paul says.
00:14:27 We have to learn to just put up with them.
00:14:31 For example, maybe a certain family
00:14:34 did not include us in a gathering at their home
00:14:37 or a brother failed to greet us
00:14:39 in the Kingdom Hall
00:14:40 or call on us to give a comment at the meeting.
00:14:44 These things may irritate us or even hurt our feelings,
00:14:49 but they are not sins  that we need to forgive.
00:14:52 They are mere slights,
00:14:55 or imperfections, that we need to learn to put up with.
00:15:00 On the other hand, if a fellow Christian
00:15:03 has actually sinned against us in some way,
00:15:06 giving us a genuine “cause for complaint,”
00:15:09 what does the scripture encourage us to do?
00:15:13 ‘Forgive one another freely.’
00:15:16 That is what Jehovah does for you and for me.
00:15:21 Putting up with and forgiving one another is vital
00:15:26 if we are to stand together as one united people.
00:15:32 Our fourth area is how we respond
00:15:35 when our brothers are in distress.
00:15:38 While coping with the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:15:41 numerous lands were hit by other disasters
00:15:44 —hurricanes, volcanoes, fires.
00:15:48 But our brothers also experience other forms of distress,
00:15:52 like the effects of old age, the loss of a loved one in death,
00:15:56 chronic health problems, and the list goes on and on.
00:16:01 What do Jehovah’s Witnesses do
00:16:04 when we see our brothers in distress?
00:16:08 We immediately
00:16:10 come to their aid.
00:16:11 We stand together.
00:16:13 In this very selfish
00:16:15 and divided world,
00:16:18 this is not a small thing.
00:16:23 It is not something to take for granted.
00:16:27 Jesus said
00:16:29 at John 13:34, 35
00:16:33 that this deep,
00:16:35 unselfish love in action
00:16:39 would identify his true disciples.
00:16:42 Therefore, brothers and sisters,
00:16:45 as we work hard to stand together
00:16:48 in the four areas that we have discussed,
00:16:52 we give powerful evidence
00:16:55 that we are true disciples of Christ Jesus.
00:16:59 Jesus knew that unity was vital.
00:17:03 On the night before he was put to death, he was concerned
00:17:07 that his disciples would remain united.
00:17:11 He prayed at John chapter 17
00:17:15 and verses 20-22:
00:17:19 “I make request, not concerning these only,
00:17:23 “but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word,
00:17:28 “so that they may all be one,
00:17:31 “just as you, Father, are in union with me
00:17:34 “and I am in union with you,
00:17:36 “that they also may be in union with us,
00:17:40 “so that the world may believe that you sent me.
00:17:44 “I have given them the glory that you have given me,
00:17:48 “in order that they may be one
00:17:51 just as we are one.”
00:17:55 Obviously, Jehovah answered that prayer.
00:17:59 He is teaching us
00:18:01 to stand together as one united people.
00:18:05 Therefore, dear brothers and sisters,
00:18:09 let us renew our determination
00:18:12 to protect our Christian unity
00:18:15 by following direction
00:18:17 from Jehovah’s organization,
00:18:19 by valuing Jehovah’s thinking
00:18:22 more than our own culture,
00:18:24 by putting up with
00:18:26 and forgiving one another freely,
00:18:29 and by helping one another
00:18:31 in times of distress.
00:18:33 By doing so,
00:18:35 we will not allow Satan
00:18:37 to steal our precious unity.
00:18:40 Instead, we will stand together
00:18:44 as one united people.
00:18:49 Without question, the COVID pandemic
00:18:51 has been a time of distress for everyone.
00:18:54 Sadly, some of our brothers and sisters
00:18:57 lost family members to the virus.
00:19:00 How could love be shown to these dear ones
00:19:03 in the midst of the pandemic?
00:19:05 We’ll see how this was accomplished in our next video.
00:19:11 My husband contracted COVID-19.
00:19:13 He was brought to the ICU,
00:19:15 and two days later, he passed away.
00:19:18 We weren’t able to say goodbye.
00:19:21 We weren’t able to see each other.
00:19:22 We weren’t able to have
00:19:24 our last conversation.
00:19:29 My husband and I got sick
00:19:31 in the month of March 2020,
00:19:33 and then my husband fell asleep in death.
00:19:40 Isolation can make you depressed.
00:19:44 I would say that was the worst time of my life.
00:19:49 My husband contracted COVID,
00:19:51 and he was breathing heavily.
00:19:55 So I called 911.
00:19:57 The ambulance took him,
00:20:02 and on the way to the hospital, his heart stopped.
00:20:09 My bank account was blocked,
00:20:11 I had debts,
00:20:14 I had COVID,
00:20:16 and the landlord gave me a week to leave the house.
00:20:21 My husband used to do everything, and now it’s
00:20:25 my responsibility to be the spiritual head of the family.
00:20:29 I needed help.
00:20:31 The elders helped me prepare for our family worship.
00:20:35 That’s exactly what we needed at that moment.
00:20:39 There were times I felt dejected
00:20:43 and weak.
00:20:45 The sisters really helped me
00:20:48 by showing personal interest.
00:20:50 In fact, not a day went by without them calling me.
00:20:55 I was feeling tired, without strength.
00:20:59 I felt helpless.
00:21:01 So the friends took care
00:21:04 of the entire move, helped to clean the house,
00:21:06 and helped me out financially.
00:21:08 They were like my arms and legs.
00:21:11 They supported me.
00:21:13 I felt like my spiritual family was carrying me in their arms.
00:21:18 Everything that my brothers and sisters
00:21:20 did for me during that difficult time
00:21:23 —the messages, the postcards, the flowers—
00:21:28 that shows me the kind of family that I have.
00:21:30 That’s what the kids really needed to see
00:21:34 —that we were not alone, that our friends were there, even though
00:21:39 they couldn’t be here physically with us.
00:21:41 The brothers have encouraged me
00:21:45 in so many ways,
00:21:50 from letters from pioneers
00:21:52 spread all over Italy
00:21:55 to video calls, phone calls, and messages.
00:22:01 I realized
00:22:03 that there will always be someone
00:22:06 who Jehovah uses to comfort me.
00:22:09 Before, I felt weak and powerless.
00:22:12 Jehovah gave me strength;
00:22:14 he helped me by means of the brothers.
00:22:18 The day after my husband died, I was
00:22:22 so surprised when I opened the door and our friends started singing for us.
00:22:44 At that moment, I realized,
00:22:47 ‘We’re not going to be alone.
00:22:49 We have our spiritual family.’
00:22:51 I began to speak to Jehovah more intensely.
00:22:55 Before, I would talk to my husband
00:22:59 about everything.
00:23:01 Now I share my problems
00:23:03 and anxieties with Jehovah.
00:23:06 I’ve been keeping a little journal
00:23:08 of everything that Jehovah has done for us, and I write it down
00:23:12 because I want to be able to tell my husband when I see him again.
00:23:16 I didn’t feel alone at any time.
00:23:18 I felt that I belonged to a family
00:23:20 that was caring for me and supporting me.
00:23:24 I really saw Jehovah’s love
00:23:28 and the help he gives.
00:23:31 He can do anything to help you feel better
00:23:35 when you are going through trials.
00:23:37 Seeing Jehovah’s support for me by means of the brothers
00:23:40 makes me feel secure when thinking about how
00:23:42 he will support me in the future.
00:23:44 I can say that in the future,
00:23:47 I am absolutely certain
00:23:50 that Jehovah will be with me.
00:23:53 There’s no pandemic
00:23:55 and there’s no bad situation
00:23:58 that will prevent Jehovah from reaching anyone
00:24:02 when they’re going through trials.
00:24:07 Our hearts go out to all
00:24:09 who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.
00:24:12 We are not shielded from “time and unexpected events.”
00:24:16 But Jehovah always helps us to endure hardship,
00:24:21 often through the love shown
00:24:23 by our brothers and sisters.
00:24:26 We help each other during crises.
00:24:29 We also show love in everyday matters,
00:24:32 as we’ll see in the following video.
00:25:14 Everything I know about Kingdom Hall maintenance,
00:25:17 I learned from Brother Ho-jin Kang.
00:25:20 He encouraged me when I needed a little push,
00:25:27 taught me the right way to do things,
00:25:32 and continued to teach me
00:25:34 with kindness and love.
00:25:42 So when he asked to borrow a ladder,
00:25:45 I was happy to lend him mine.
00:25:53 Honey,
00:25:56 here are some things I need
00:25:58 for our lunch today with the Youngs.
00:26:01 Mhm.
00:26:02 What’s the ladder for?
00:26:04 Ah, Ho-jin needs it.
00:26:06 Ho-jin?
00:26:07 How’s he doing?
00:26:09 I heard something about a cane.
00:26:11 Ho-jin?
00:26:12 A cane?
00:26:14 No way!
00:26:15 He’s still as strong as an ox.
00:26:17 Maybe, but it seems like—
00:26:21 Well, you’ll see how he’s doing.
00:26:24 And don’t forget to stop at the store.
00:26:28 Ho-jin?
00:26:29 A cane?
00:26:31 No way.
00:26:46 I’m coming!
00:26:47 Here I come!
00:26:50 Oh, sorry.
00:26:51 It’s OK.
00:26:53 Is everything OK?
00:26:54 I just can’t dash down the stairs.
00:26:58 I was on my way to the store and thought I’d drop off the ladder.
00:27:02 Thanks!
00:27:04 Just leave it by the garage.
00:27:06 It’s almost time for lunch.
00:27:08 The gutters can wait.
00:27:09 They’ve waited this long.
00:27:12 OK. Will do.
00:27:14 Bye.
00:27:15 Drive safe!
00:27:33 Gutters?
00:27:53 Hi, Honey.
00:27:55 OK. But what about lunch?
00:27:59 The Youngs will be here in an hour.
00:28:01 I know.
00:28:02 I picked up the items you asked for, but I can’t just leave.
00:28:07 It got me thinking about the neighborly Samaritan.
00:28:13 When we see a need,
00:28:15 we can’t be like the priest and Levite
00:28:17 who just walked away.
00:28:25 The Samaritan cared enough to stop,
00:28:28 examine the need,
00:28:38 and took the time to help the poor man
00:28:44 —a man he didn’t even know.
00:28:46 . . . a man he didn’t even know. Of course!
00:28:49 “Work what is good toward all,
00:28:51 but especially toward those related to us in the faith.”
00:28:55 I love you.
00:28:56 And I have an idea.
00:28:58 Let’s not cancel with the Youngs.
00:29:00 I’ll go back and pick up my ladder and tell Ho-jin
00:29:04 that I’ll come back Saturday afternoon to help him clean out the gutters.
00:29:17 It’s such a blessing
00:29:19 to be able to care for the needs of our brothers
00:29:25 and feel their loving care for us.
00:29:35 What do we learn from this dramatization?
00:29:39 When we think deeply about the needs of our brothers,
00:29:43 we’ll find many opportunities
00:29:45 to show unselfish love.
00:29:49 In this world, people feel unloved
00:29:52 and isolated for many reasons.
00:29:56 We’ll see this in the experience of Jeson Senajonon.
00:30:01 Life was simple—I remember.
00:30:04 I am Jeson, and I am deaf.
00:30:09 Growing up with this disability was hard.
00:30:12 When I was younger, I saw people laughing
00:30:14 and families showing affection.
00:30:19 I just walked around the neighborhood
00:30:20 and observed what was going on around me.
00:30:24 I saw them walking and talking
00:30:26 and wondered what that was all about.
00:30:29 Everything was a mystery to me.
00:30:33 But one day was a little different.
00:30:36 I saw children my age having fun,
00:30:39 and they wanted me to play with them.
00:30:43 I said to myself: ‘Me?
00:30:47 I can’t believe they actually want me to be with them.’
00:30:52 For once I felt welcomed, and that was how we became
00:30:56 the best of friends.
00:31:01 Time went by so fast.
00:31:03 We grew up spending time
00:31:05 and discovering new things together.
00:31:08 I was having so much fun with their company
00:31:10 that even questionable acts seemed right to me.
00:31:13 I learned how to smoke.
00:31:14 They taught me how to drink alcohol
00:31:16 to my heart’s content.
00:31:21 It felt like it was the best time of our lives.
00:31:23 I thought everything we did
00:31:26 was how things were actually supposed to be.
00:31:44 One day in a deaf search in our area,
00:31:48 the Witnesses found me.
00:31:52 I was hesitant at first, but they were very kind and friendly.
00:31:59 They educated me;
00:32:02 they even taught me how to sign my name.
00:32:08 Eventually, I studied the Bible with them.
00:32:13 I learned different truths from the Bible
00:32:17 and finally came to know Jehovah, “the only true God.”
00:32:22 I learned the things Jehovah liked and disapproved of.
00:32:26 Our Bible study moved me to reexamine the life I lived.
00:32:31 I realized that what I did before
00:32:33 wasn’t pleasing to Jehovah.
00:32:37 My love for Jehovah grew deeper,
00:32:39 and I knew exactly what I wanted to do.
00:32:44 I started to attend Christian meetings,
00:32:47 and I met new friends in the congregation.
00:32:53 The Bible changed my life.
00:32:57 I gave my all to Jehovah and decided
00:32:59 to dedicate myself to him.
00:33:02 It brought me nothing but real happiness.
00:33:12 Now I’m in full-time service
00:33:15 and eagerly declaring the good news.
00:33:18 I was appointed
00:33:21 to serve as a ministerial servant in our congregation,
00:33:26 and I was called to volunteer at Bethel too.
00:33:39 I wouldn’t have felt genuine happiness in accomplishing
00:33:42 these spiritual assignments if I wasn’t in Jehovah’s organization.
00:33:51 To all the deaf ones out there
00:33:53 that haven’t had the chance to know Jehovah yet,
00:33:56 I hope and encourage you
00:33:58 to study the Bible with the Witnesses too.
00:34:01 Look at me.
00:34:02 Before, I wasn’t able to read and write.
00:34:06 I realize that even if we can’t hear,
00:34:10 we can still have a relationship with the only true God.
00:34:14 I hope you find the same love and joy as I did
00:34:17 under Jehovah’s loving hands.
00:34:20 Jehovah has helped me,
00:34:22 and for that I will always thank and love him
00:34:25 with all my heart.
00:34:30 If you are deaf and you would like to learn more about the Bible,
00:34:34 we hope you are watching
00:34:36 a sign-language interpretation of this program
00:34:40 and that you’ll accept Jeson’s invitation to study the Bible
00:34:44 with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:34:46 You too can develop an intimate relationship with God
00:34:51 and become part of a loving, united family.
00:34:56 As we discussed earlier,
00:34:58 our unity can suffer
00:35:00 if we allow minor matters to affect us.
00:35:03 In our next video,
00:35:06 notice what we can do to set aside such feelings
00:35:09 and preserve unity.
00:35:13 Many years ago, I started working at a firm,
00:35:16 and I helped a sister to get a position
00:35:19 at the same firm.
00:35:21 As time went on, I may have come
00:35:24 to the wrong conclusion, but I felt
00:35:27 that this sister wanted to be in charge.
00:35:29 I didn’t feel very happy about it.
00:35:33 A few months later, I was retrenched from work.
00:35:38 I felt very hurt.
00:35:41 My mother always told me
00:35:43 to be the “lesser one” and just to let things go.
00:35:47 So I kept quiet, and I left the firm.
00:35:51 Because of certain circumstances,
00:35:54 we changed congregations, so we didn’t see each other anymore.
00:35:59 During those years, at the meetings
00:36:02 or reading the Bible,
00:36:04 we were regularly reminded to be forgiving.
00:36:08 It felt to me like a stab in my heart
00:36:13 because I knew we had to apply this counsel.
00:36:20 Being at the convention, every time,
00:36:23 made me a bit nervous
00:36:27 because I basically had to prepare myself.
00:36:30 Should I bump into her,
00:36:33 how was I going to handle it?
00:36:35 It did ruin the spiritual atmosphere of the convention.
00:36:42 Soon after my mother passed away,
00:36:45 we had our regional convention.
00:36:48 I was very emotional.
00:36:50 I saw this sister standing there, and I wondered to myself,
00:36:53 ‘What is going to happen now?’
00:36:56 She came up to me;
00:36:58 she gave me a hug and a small present.
00:37:02 That particular day,
00:37:05 I definitely felt relieved and I felt
00:37:09 that I could now make peace.
00:37:12 If both of us had applied earlier
00:37:16 the advice given at Colossians 3:13
00:37:20 by being forgiving,
00:37:22 neither of us would have had to carry
00:37:25 this emotional burden for so many years.
00:37:29 Now I am very happy to say,
00:37:32 Mona and I are good friends today.
00:37:38 We serve together in the same congregation
00:37:40 as elders, and the relationship
00:37:42 that I have today with Luis is that we’re friends.
00:37:46 But when we transferred it to the workplace,
00:37:48 that beautiful friendship began to fade.
00:37:53 Well, as a builder,
00:37:55 I’m old-school and used to being in charge.
00:37:58 Perhaps I was too proud.
00:38:00 But somebody couldn’t come and tell me how to do certain things.
00:38:04 Since I was the crew leader, I said right from the start:
00:38:07 “So, what is he doing here?
00:38:10 Does he have any right to an opinion about this?”
00:38:14 So I made sure to push the brother aside completely.
00:38:17 I can remember that when I entered the Kingdom Hall through one door
00:38:21 and I saw Brother Luis,
00:38:23 I would look for any possible excuse to avoid him.
00:38:27 I wouldn’t even say hello.
00:38:29 Neither of us said hello.
00:38:32 For me, the internal battle between the fleshly-minded person
00:38:36 and the spiritual person was a very tough battle.
00:38:40 It was like that for several years.
00:38:42 And now I think, ‘I wasted time.’
00:38:47 Something that would have helped me to maintain peace and unity
00:38:50 with my brother would have been to be obedient to what Jehovah says,
00:38:54 to what the Bible says, and to what we hear at the meetings.
00:38:59 Sadly, I wasn’t obedient.
00:39:03 The lesson that I have learned from this is that Jehovah is always right.
00:39:09 In the exact moment when something happens,
00:39:11 we should immediately act.
00:39:14 Carlos Henry himself was the one that then stopped me and told me,
00:39:18 “We can’t keep going on like this.”
00:39:21 He took a very important step
00:39:24 so that we could sort things out.
00:39:27 To be happy, you have to apply the principles you find in God’s Word.
00:39:32 The words at Romans 14:19
00:39:35 encourage us to “pursue the things making for peace.”
00:39:40 What I would’ve done differently is that I wouldn’t have let time go by.
00:39:45 Instead, I should have sought out the brother
00:39:48 more promptly and restored that friendship again.
00:39:52 Although it’s true that you can’t recover time,
00:39:55 you can recover a brother.
00:39:57 My relationship, once again, with Luis is that we are friends,
00:40:01 and he’s a true friend.
00:40:05 After Cecilia was “retrenched”
00:40:08 —that is, she lost her job—
00:40:11 she resented her spiritual sister for a time.
00:40:14 This robbed her of her peace.
00:40:18 Carlos and Luis also allowed
00:40:20 petty differences to divide them.
00:40:23 The lesson is clear:
00:40:26 “[Put] up with” and “[forgive] one another.”
00:40:31 We delight in the variety of cultures
00:40:34 represented in our brotherhood.
00:40:36 But as we’ll see in our next segment,
00:40:39 we have to be vigilant not to put our local culture
00:40:43 ahead of Bible principles.
00:40:46 Growing up in Canada,
00:40:48 I had a view of what hospitality was.
00:40:50 Hospitality was
00:40:52 to have the brothers and sisters over,
00:40:53 get to know them, and share a meal together
00:40:56 —something that I planned to offer to them.
00:40:59 I don’t think I ever realized
00:41:00 how much I had been influenced
00:41:03 by my own culture
00:41:05 in defining what I thought hospitality was.
00:41:10 Culture has a very big effect on us.
00:41:14 In our culture
00:41:15 young ones are not trusted very much.
00:41:17 They are not given responsibility.
00:41:20 I have seen the effect of the culture
00:41:23 inside the congregation, especially when the question
00:41:26 of giving younger ones more privileges of service,
00:41:29 or assignments, came up.
00:41:31 When it was discussed among the elders,
00:41:33 it would not really be considered.
00:41:36 And so the desire would be for him to wait a little bit longer
00:41:39 —mature a little more and gain more life experience.
00:41:43 I also thought the same way.
00:41:45 When I look back now, I realize that it really wasn’t right
00:41:49 because Jehovah’s thinking isn’t like that.
00:41:52 So when I attended the special convention in Ukraine,
00:41:55 my view of what hospitality was changed completely.
00:42:00 We get off the plane; all the brothers are there;
00:42:05 we see the love.
00:42:06 We’re overwhelmed by just the quantity of brothers that are there
00:42:09 —their smiles, their expressions.
00:42:12 As the days went on,
00:42:16 it was clear that they were just looking
00:42:19 for what we needed.
00:42:21 And it was more than, you know, just giving us some food
00:42:23 and spending some time with us.
00:42:25 There were so many other things that they did
00:42:29 that covered every one of our needs
00:42:31 when I was not sure that their own needs were being covered at times.
00:42:35 They knew they just wanted
00:42:37 to be there, and they’d figure out the rest when they got there.
00:42:40 And that really impressed me and my wife.
00:42:44 I do remember one night getting back to the hotel,
00:42:48 and we had a moment
00:42:53 to just really think about what we’d seen that day
00:42:57 and started to ask ourselves if we’d ever gone to the same extent.
00:43:01 Where I’m from,
00:43:04 we tend to stick with what we’re very comfortable with.
00:43:07 I realized that I really had unknowingly been putting limits
00:43:12 on hospitality because of what I was comfortable with
00:43:15 —because of the culture where I grew up—
00:43:19 whereas the experience in Ukraine helped me to see
00:43:22 that we can break that barrier down so much faster.
00:43:26 We could definitely feel that this was what Jehovah’s view of hospitality was.
00:43:31 It was about looking for what others need and filling those needs.
00:43:37 In time, my thinking changed
00:43:39 because I realized Jehovah’s way of thinking.
00:43:43 The videos produced by Jehovah’s organization and what I watched in them
00:43:48 helped my view to change.
00:43:51 I could actually see what a young brother or a young elder could do.
00:43:57 In the past, we used to focus on experience.
00:44:00 I would too.
00:44:01 But now Jehovah’s viewpoint is more important than just experience.
00:44:06 Jehovah doesn’t only focus on experience
00:44:09 but also on spiritual qualities.
00:44:12 I came to realize that.
00:44:14 So after we experienced
00:44:17 the special convention in Ukraine and returned home,
00:44:20 we decided that we needed to consider this more as a Family Worship project.
00:44:24 We realized we did have to make some adjustments.
00:44:27 We realized we did want to do more.
00:44:30 So we had to set specific goals
00:44:33 to be able to strip away
00:44:35 our previous definition of hospitality
00:44:38 and start extending it beyond what we were comfortable with.
00:44:42 It takes work
00:44:45 to continually break free from the limits
00:44:49 that we might set for ourselves.
00:44:51 And it was something that we realized
00:44:55 —we needed to make some changes if we were going to maintain
00:44:59 Jehovah’s view of hospitality moving forward.
00:45:02 Of course, the influence of the culture doesn’t go away overnight.
00:45:06 We still need to work hard on it.
00:45:09 We still have to change
00:45:11 because traces of the culture can still be left over.
00:45:14 But I realized we definitely need to get rid of it.
00:45:20 Now I’m really pleased to serve with those young brothers,
00:45:23 to talk with them,
00:45:25 and to see their potential as Jehovah sees it.
00:45:29 We can also see that Jehovah is very pleased too.
00:45:34 Jehovah is overjoyed.
00:45:37 He’s proud to see what those young brothers do.
00:45:43 Like our brothers in the video,
00:45:46 it’s good for each of us to do
00:45:48 a prayerful self-examination.
00:45:51 If we always put Bible principles
00:45:54 ahead of our local culture,
00:45:57 we strengthen our precious Christian unity.
00:46:02 The Internet and other technologies
00:46:05 allow the Governing Body to serve the brotherhood
00:46:08 in ways not possible just a few years ago.
00:46:12 The tools may be new,
00:46:14 but the work is not.
00:46:17 In our next segment,
00:46:19 we’ll learn what past members of the Governing Body did
00:46:22 to stay connected with
00:46:24 and to serve Jehovah’s people everywhere.
00:46:29 The Governing Body has always felt a keen responsibility
00:46:33 to live up to Jesus’ command:
00:46:35 “Feed my lambs. . . . Shepherd my little sheep.”
00:46:37 Today’s technology
00:46:39 makes the Governing Body feel like family.
00:46:42 But did the worldwide brotherhood in times past
00:46:45 enjoy such a strong bond with the Governing Body?
00:46:54 Let’s go back to January of 1945.
00:46:59 Brothers Knorr and Franz
00:47:00 set out on a tour of Latin America
00:47:02 that ended up with conventions in North America.
00:47:06 It took four months.
00:47:08 The purpose was to visit
00:47:10 branches already established,
00:47:13 to organize new branches,
00:47:15 and to forward the movement
00:47:17 of the Kingdom preaching work.
00:47:19 Service tours often combined
00:47:21 supervising operations at a branch,
00:47:23 giving talks at conventions,
00:47:25 dedicating new facilities,
00:47:28 overnight visits to remote missionary homes,
00:47:30 followed by evening meetings with a local congregation.
00:47:34 All this was packed into a few days.
00:47:37 They provided instruction
00:47:39 on the field ministry,
00:47:40 how to conduct meetings,
00:47:42 and also on what was taking place in the worldwide field.
00:47:45 And then they would take time
00:47:47 to go out into the field ministry with them.
00:47:50 One such visit included a stopover in Guatemala,
00:47:53 where they visited a very small congregation
00:47:56 of just eight people.
00:47:58 Their heart was in the preaching work.
00:48:00 I can speak from my own experience
00:48:02 that the missionaries were very close to Brother Knorr’s heart.
00:48:06 So after sending them first to Latin America,
00:48:10 he was eager to see their progress.
00:48:12 And so he visited them.
00:48:15 And then, over the years, he traveled the world
00:48:17 and he visited as many missionary homes
00:48:19 as he possibly could.
00:48:21 He privately met each missionary personally
00:48:24 to talk over their challenges,
00:48:26 to arrange for better accommodations if needed,
00:48:29 to assess the potential for growth,
00:48:31 or even to establish a new branch
00:48:34 or arrange to purchase new property
00:48:36 if needed.
00:48:38 Brother Knorr loved the brotherhood,
00:48:40 especially missionaries
00:48:42 and branch personnel.
00:48:43 And he would take the opportunity
00:48:45 of a 15- or 20-minute stopover
00:48:48 in a train station or an airport
00:48:50 to give encouragement
00:48:52 or to help them to advance the preaching work.
00:48:58 Brother Knorr had deep concern
00:49:01 for the welfare of the brothers
00:49:03 in the war-torn countries of Europe.
00:49:06 Brothers Knorr and Henschel
00:49:08 traveled to Britain, France,
00:49:11 Switzerland, Belgium,
00:49:13 the Netherlands, and Scandinavia
00:49:15 in November 1945.
00:49:18 Imagine, just a few months
00:49:20 after World War II ended,
00:49:23 the railroad track was destroyed and bridges were destroyed.
00:49:26 So there were no good connections
00:49:28 between the cities.
00:49:30 It was not tourist travel;
00:49:32 it was really hard work.
00:49:35 But even this they did
00:49:39 because of loving the brothers
00:49:41 and helping and encouraging
00:49:44 the brothers in these countries.
00:49:52 After visiting the friends in war-torn Europe,
00:49:54 then Brothers Knorr and Henschel embarked
00:49:56 on a very ambitious and extensive
00:49:59 47,000-mile (76,000 km) tour.
00:50:01 They visited some lands
00:50:03 where there were few or even no Witnesses.
00:50:06 If no branch operated in a country they visited,
00:50:08 they connected with the local congregations
00:50:10 in private homes,
00:50:12 they attended their meetings,
00:50:14 and they accompanied the local publishers
00:50:16 to the homes of interested ones for group meetings.
00:50:20 And they often rented venues for public meetings.
00:50:23 Brothers Knorr and Henschel went on the streets to advertise the talk
00:50:27 that evening.
00:50:29 And then Brother Knorr himself even rode with bicycle parades
00:50:32 to advertise his talks.
00:50:34 And these meetings attracted hundreds of interested ones,
00:50:37 even though in one city,
00:50:39 there was a threatening note that was received.
00:50:44 Well, things don’t always turn out as planned.
00:50:46 Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel
00:50:48 had a service tour of countries in Africa.
00:50:51 One of those was Nigeria,
00:50:53 and they were to give talks at two conventions.
00:50:55 One of those conventions was 400 miles (640 km) away
00:50:58 and involved a road trip.
00:51:00 So they got off to an early start at 3:30 in the morning.
00:51:03 On into the trip, they started to have car problems.
00:51:06 Those car problems turned into a grueling 18-hour delay,
00:51:10 and they realized they weren’t going to make the convention.
00:51:13 So they decided to go back to the branch in Lagos.
00:51:15 But the return trip took 24 hours
00:51:19 through jungle roads and additional car problems.
00:51:21 They got back to the branch,
00:51:23 they took a very brief rest,
00:51:26 and they were on to the next branch.
00:51:28 Brother Knorr loved the brothers,
00:51:30 and he enjoyed being with them.
00:51:32 I remember very well
00:51:34 how after his concluding talk,
00:51:36 he waved to the brothers
00:51:38 and we in the audience took out handkerchiefs
00:51:42 and waved back for many minutes.
00:51:44 But that was not all.
00:51:46 He and Brother Henschel then went to the railroad station
00:51:49 to say farewell to the brothers leaving in special trains.
00:51:53 They called out “Auf Wiedersehen! Gute Reise!”
00:51:57 and they stayed there till 10:30 at night doing that.
00:52:01 They thought not of their comfort,
00:52:03 but they thought of the brothers.
00:52:06 A request to hold a large special meeting
00:52:09 in Athens in 1952
00:52:11 was not granted by the authorities because of religious interference.
00:52:15 But not wanting to miss an opportunity to encourage the Greek brothers,
00:52:19 Brother Knorr came up with an alternate plan.
00:52:23 He and Brother Henschel would take taxis
00:52:25 to the homes of local brothers,
00:52:27 where they would give a talk for approximately 20 minutes.
00:52:30 Then they would go on to another home,
00:52:33 even though they risked arrest because of meeting together.
00:52:36 They were able to meet with 905 of our Greek brothers.
00:52:40 In describing that day, Brother Knorr wrote,
00:52:44 “It was one of the most blessed experiences
00:52:47 of our lives.”
00:52:49 Brother Franz visited Spain many times,
00:52:51 but during the 1950’s,
00:52:52 our work was under ban.
00:52:54 Brother Franz wanted to encourage the local brothers,
00:52:57 but he was especially concerned for their safety.
00:52:59 On this one event,
00:53:00 Brother Franz and his driver decided to park their car
00:53:04 near the home of their host,
00:53:06 a certain Brother Garcia, who was a mechanic.
00:53:08 So with the hood of the car open,
00:53:11 they asked a neighbor, “Is there a mechanic in the area?”
00:53:14 Of course, he was referred to Brother Garcia.
00:53:17 Brother Garcia then looked at the car and said,
00:53:19 “Your car needs to come into my shop.”
00:53:21 That was the opportunity
00:53:23 for Brother Franz to meet some local brothers and sisters.
00:53:26 When it was time to walk to the meeting later that day,
00:53:29 Brother Franz decided to wear the beret
00:53:31 and a sheepskin coat typical for the area
00:53:34 so that he would safely blend in with his brothers.
00:53:37 Well, these brothers were
00:53:39 very loving and courageous men.
00:53:41 They worked very hard
00:53:43 to keep the brothers in countries under ban fired up with zeal,
00:53:47 even risking their own safety.
00:53:49 Brother Franz actually was arrested
00:53:51 while meeting with the brothers
00:53:53 in Barcelona, Spain.
00:53:55 Well, these schedules that they kept
00:53:58 must have been exhausting.
00:54:00 If a country under ban was on the itinerary,
00:54:03 they might pay a visit to government officials
00:54:06 to promote legalization of our work.
00:54:09 Brother Knorr visited all of the branches
00:54:11 to encourage the brothers, and he talked with the missionaries.
00:54:15 But in the 1950’s, there was much growth,
00:54:18 and that proved to be too much for him alone.
00:54:20 So he decided that it would be appropriate
00:54:24 to train some of us brothers
00:54:27 so that we could assist in that work
00:54:29 and see that the shepherding was done
00:54:32 and that the work in the branches
00:54:35 was done in unity.
00:54:38 On the service tour of Africa in 1963,
00:54:41 Brother Henschel attended the convention
00:54:43 at Gbarnga, Liberia.
00:54:46 Suddenly, soldiers invaded the convention.
00:54:49 They arrested Brother Henschel and others.
00:54:52 He was mistreated
00:54:54 —beaten with a rifle butt to the point
00:54:56 where he thought he was going to die.
00:55:01 But he remained on the scene to encourage
00:55:04 and assist the brothers to be faithful,
00:55:07 to avoid compromise.
00:55:09 And when finally he was released,
00:55:11 instead of going home,
00:55:13 he completed his assignment
00:55:15 to visit other branches
00:55:17 and upon return
00:55:19 never acted the part of a hero or martyr.
00:55:23 It was just the cost of doing the Lord’s business.
00:55:28 Well, the headquarters representatives
00:55:29 wanted the best
00:55:30 for delegates to a convention.
00:55:33 Brothers Knorr and Henschel were known
00:55:35 to personally inspect venues
00:55:37 and even negotiate contracts.
00:55:39 In more recent times,
00:55:41 Brother Jaracz personally visited hotels
00:55:44 to make sure that there was a proper standard
00:55:46 of comfort and cleanliness.
00:55:48 He even tested out the beds.
00:55:51 Brother Knorr was well-aware of the situation
00:55:54 that the brothers were facing
00:55:55 in the Soviet Union.
00:55:57 He wrote many letters
00:55:59 in which he called on the brothers to live in harmony
00:56:01 under the direction of the organization.
00:56:05 One such letter fell into the hands of the KGB.
00:56:09 They altered it.
00:56:11 But when Brother Knorr was told about it,
00:56:13 he drew the brothers’ attention
00:56:15 to the spirit of the letter
00:56:17 because from the spirit of the letter
00:56:19 it would be evident immediately
00:56:20 whether it was a letter from the organization
00:56:23 or a forged letter.
00:56:25 This is because the spirit of the organization
00:56:28 serves to unite the brothers, not divide them.
00:56:32 All this attention to the international activity
00:56:34 was taking place while simultaneously directing
00:56:38 the work and expansion at world headquarters,
00:56:40 handling various legal issues,
00:56:42 organizing and speaking at conventions
00:56:45 throughout the United States,
00:56:47 Gilead School lectures and graduations,
00:56:49 annual meeting programs,
00:56:51 and all the while taking care
00:56:53 of their own spiritual well-being
00:56:55 and that of their wife if married.
00:56:58 The next few decades would see even greater growth
00:57:01 but also greater challenges.
00:57:09 What beautiful reminders
00:57:11 of the efforts our brothers made to serve our spiritual family!
00:57:16 And there’s more to share.
00:57:18 In a future broadcast, we’ll recall
00:57:21 additional ways the Governing Body has preserved unity.
00:57:26 Now it’s time for our new music video.
00:57:29 It highlights the many blessings of unity.
00:57:41 Calling out to all our brothers! Calling out for all to hear!
00:58:06 We share just one faith, one God. We’re united wherever we’re found.
00:58:18 Speaking the language of truth, We join our voices with one joyful sound.
00:58:31 Whatever we face, We’re not on our own.
00:58:38 Together we’re never alone.
00:58:45 Together, united, together we belong.
00:58:51 Together, united, together we are strong. Together, united, as one we carry on.
00:59:04 Side by side and hand in hand, together, together we are strong.
00:59:20 We’re found in all lands; it’s true. And we know that we’re not all the same.
00:59:32 Diff’rent in things we may choose, Maintaining peace for the sake of God’s name.
00:59:45 Wherever we go, Our brothers are there
00:59:51 With love and the faith we all share.
00:59:58 Together, united, together we belong.
01:00:04 Together, united, together we are strong. Together, united, as one we carry on.
01:00:17 Side by side and hand in hand, together, together we are strong.
01:00:30 Together, united, together.
01:00:56 Together, united, together we belong.
01:01:02 Together, united, together we are strong. Together, united, as one we carry on.
01:01:15 Side by side and hand in hand, together, together we are strong.
01:01:28 Together we are strong. Together we are strong.
01:01:43 This month’s program encouraged us
01:01:46 to “Stand Together as One United People.”
01:01:50 At times we may be isolated, but with Jehovah,
01:01:54 we are never alone.
01:01:57 We learned not to allow petty matters or cultural norms
01:02:01 to disrupt our unity.
01:02:03 By building a close relationship with Jehovah,
01:02:07 Jeson became a member of a loving family.
01:02:11 We were encouraged to seek
01:02:14 opportunities to show unselfish love.
01:02:17 And we reflected on the many ways the Governing Body
01:02:20 has worked to keep us as a united people.
01:02:26 In this month’s video postcard,
01:02:28 we go to the island of Newfoundland in Canada.
01:02:32 A large island at the far eastern coast of North America,
01:02:37 Newfoundland is an amazing place of unique
01:02:41 contrasts in weather, geography,
01:02:44 and natural beauty.
01:02:47 Sister Edith Mason brought the truth here
01:02:49 more than a century ago.
01:02:51 She was a single, full-time minister in Nova Scotia.
01:02:56 In 1914, she resolved to go by herself
01:03:00 to preach in Newfoundland where there were no Witnesses at that time.
01:03:05 After much prayer and planning,
01:03:08 she arranged for the “Photo-Drama of Creation”
01:03:11 to be brought here in 1916.
01:03:15 Over 10,000 people
01:03:17 viewed this ground-breaking presentation.
01:03:21 Some of the early preaching work was done by boat.
01:03:24 Over the years, the brothers used four missionary boats
01:03:28 to cover over 6,400 kilometers,
01:03:33 or more than 4,000 miles, of coastal territory.
01:03:38 After the second world war, spiritual activity increased.
01:03:42 In 1945,
01:03:44 a branch office was established,
01:03:46 and the first group of Gilead-trained missionaries arrived.
01:03:50 The branch office continued to operate
01:03:53 until 1981.
01:03:55 Gilead graduates Bernie and Elizabeth Mahler were assigned to Newfoundland.
01:04:00 They helped establish a congregation
01:04:02 in Bonavista in 1952.
01:04:06 Today, the Bonavista Congregation has
01:04:09 38 publishers and 4 regular pioneers.
01:04:13 The need remains great in Newfoundland.
01:04:16 Almost 30 percent of Canada’s unassigned territory is here.
01:04:21 When publishers come to help,
01:04:23 they enjoy Newfoundland’s
01:04:25 well-known, warm hospitality.
01:04:29 Our brothers and sisters in the Bonavista Congregation
01:04:32 send you their love and greetings!
01:04:36 Earlier, we shared a preview
01:04:38 of this year’s “Pursue Peace”! Regional Convention.
01:04:42 Now we’d like to give you a glimpse
01:04:45 of the convention’s feature Bible drama:
01:04:48 Jehovah Guides Us in the Way of Peace.
01:04:53 There is a God in the heavens
01:04:55 who is a Revealer of secrets,
01:04:58 and he has made known
01:04:59 to King Nebuchadnezzar
01:05:01 what is to happen
01:05:02 in the final part of the days.
01:05:08 The divine dream
01:05:10 that Daniel interprets for King Nebuchadnezzar
01:05:13 constitutes a prophecy
01:05:15 crucial for the lasting peace of mankind.
01:05:19 Jehovah knows the course of history centuries, even millenniums, in advance.
01:05:24 And as the toes of the feet
01:05:26 were partly of iron and partly of clay,
01:05:29 so the kingdom will be partly strong
01:05:32 and partly fragile.
01:05:38 History has shown us how every type
01:05:41 of human government imaginable has failed.
01:05:45 It’s only Jehovah who has the ability
01:05:47 to guide humans to real, lasting peace.
01:05:53 He has led his people in the past.
01:05:56 So when he prophesies
01:05:58 that he’ll lead his people to real,
01:06:00 lasting peace in the future,
01:06:03 this isn’t a prediction; it’s a guarantee!
01:06:07 The peace we seek is certain under God’s Kingdom.
01:06:18 I’d like to share one more reason
01:06:21 to be excited about the convention.
01:06:23 It’s my pleasure to announce
01:06:26 that we’ll conclude the convention
01:06:28 with a new original song.
01:06:31 The song and lyrics are now available
01:06:34 on jw.org.
01:06:36 The Governing Body requests that all of us
01:06:39 practice the new song.
01:06:41 And if someone needs help to download the song,
01:06:45 please give them a hand and practice with them.
01:06:48 Then together we’ll sing out with all of our hearts
01:06:52 to Jehovah’s praise.
01:06:55 As we conclude this month’s program,
01:06:58 please know that we sincerely love
01:07:02 and appreciate each one of you.
01:07:05 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:07:08 this is JW Broadcasting.
