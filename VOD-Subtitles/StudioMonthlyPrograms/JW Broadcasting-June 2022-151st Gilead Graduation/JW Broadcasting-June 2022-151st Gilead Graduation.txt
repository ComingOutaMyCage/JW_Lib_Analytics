00:00:02 We are delighted to welcome one and all
00:00:07 to the June 2022 program
00:00:10 of JW Broadcasting®!
00:00:32 Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:00:35 all of the students
00:00:36 in the previous class of Gilead
00:00:39 were from the United States.
00:00:41 However, we were very happy that the Governing Body approved
00:00:46 for 24 fully vaccinated brothers and sisters
00:00:50 from 13 different lands
00:00:53 to be invited to the 151st class of Gilead.
00:00:59 On March 12, 2022,
00:01:03 this enthusiastic class graduated.
00:01:07 How did they personally benefit from the school?
00:01:12 How will they use their five months of Bible training?
00:01:16 Where will they be assigned?
00:01:19 Please enjoy Part 1
00:01:22 of the 151st Gilead graduation program.
00:01:28 Well, class 151,
00:01:30 you seem excited, and you should be.
00:01:34 This is a very special day for you —one you’ll never forget.
00:01:37 Just as with the entire course of Gilead, you’ll never forget.
00:01:42 And we’re happy to be with you today.
00:01:44 And we will all benefit from the things that are said today
00:01:48 at this spiritual program.
00:01:52 But even so, we know that although this will benefit everyone involved,
00:01:57 the program has been designed with you in mind.
00:02:01 So with every talk given,
00:02:03 the brothers have prayerfully considered what can be said to encourage.
00:02:08 And as you listen, just be certain that the brothers have had that in mind.
00:02:11 But all of us listening today will benefit
00:02:14 from the good things that will come out in this program.
00:02:17 When the day is over, you’ll look back and recall a program
00:02:20 that honored Jehovah and confirmed his love for you.
00:02:24 And again, you’re never going to forget it.
00:02:27 During the past five months of your schooling, you were asked to draw out
00:02:31 principles from many different Bible accounts.
00:02:34 And you worked hard to do that, didn’t you?
00:02:37 You learned new ways to do that,
00:02:39 to see the Scriptures
00:02:41 as something that Jehovah wants us to listen to very carefully
00:02:46 and then apply its fine points in our lives.
00:02:49 So those accounts focused on genuine servants of God
00:02:54 who with his help succeeded in doing His will.
00:02:57 And you were doing the same.
00:03:00 You examined principles for Christian living,
00:03:02 you examined principles for teaching others,
00:03:05 you looked at principles
00:03:07 about how to organize the work, and so forth.
00:03:10 This graduation program will do the same.
00:03:14 With that in mind, I have a theme for these brief introductory comments.
00:03:19 I thought it would keep me focused.
00:03:20 So here’s my theme:
00:03:22 “You Are Ready to Face the Things Ahead.”
00:03:26 Now, notice that it’s not a question: Are you ready?
00:03:29 It’s a statement: You are ready to face the things ahead.
00:03:34 Now, why can we say this with such confidence?
00:03:38 Because we see your faith.
00:03:40 We see your deep love for our heavenly Father, Jehovah,
00:03:44 and his Son.
00:03:46 You’ve trusted in Jehovah, you have done well,
00:03:49 and you’ve made it to graduation day.
00:03:52 I know some of you wondered if you would make it, but you did.
00:03:55 Here you are.
00:03:56 You’re graduating with the 151st class of Gilead.
00:04:01 What a delight!
00:04:02 You undoubtedly agree more than ever before with what the apostle Paul wrote
00:04:07  at Philippians 4:13,
00:04:11 where he said: “For all things I have the strength through [who?]
00:04:16 the one who gives me power.”
00:04:19 And we know who that is.
00:04:21 Jehovah has surely helped you during these months
00:04:25 to make a success of Gilead school.
00:04:28 And we’re very proud of you for that.
00:04:30 You can be certain that Jehovah is just delighted to see that
00:04:33 because you love him
00:04:35 and you went through this course, you’ve gone through it
00:04:39 with that in mind, true?
00:04:42 Jehovah gave you what you needed,
00:04:44 and that’s a blessing you must never forget.
00:04:47 By remembering it, you will put that blessing to work for you
00:04:51 wherever you are in your service to Jehovah
00:04:54 in the weeks, months, and years ahead.
00:04:57 Really, these things you learn and that all of us learn now
00:05:00 will serve us well forever.
00:05:03 For example, whenever you face a task in the future
00:05:07 that seems almost too large for you to tackle or handle,
00:05:11 you’ll remember how Jehovah helped you in this school.
00:05:15 Your experience in going through Gilead
00:05:19 now adds to your extensive experience,
00:05:23 the experience you already had in serving Jehovah,
00:05:26 but this just enriches it that much more.
00:05:29 It will help you as you face
00:05:32 trials and tests ahead
00:05:35 in that you’ll know you can make it through what you may view as difficult times
00:05:39 because Jehovah will help you to do it.
00:05:41 You are growing ever more and more ready to face the things ahead.
00:05:46 You already are, but you’ll grow more and more so, like all of us will,
00:05:51 as you reflect on and remember what Jehovah has done for you,
00:05:55 such as helping you to complete this Bible school course.
00:06:00 Here’s an example of things you must be ready to handle or you may face.
00:06:05 Soon after your graduation, you will be off to your assignments.
00:06:09 And as you go,
00:06:11 have in mind Jesus’ words, where he taught his disciples to pray:
00:06:15 “Do not bring us into temptation,
00:06:18 but deliver us from the wicked one.”
00:06:21 Now focus on the words
00:06:23 “temptation” and “wicked one.”
00:06:26 They go together, don’t they?
00:06:28 Temptation and wicked one.
00:06:30 Satan, “the wicked one,” doesn’t like your success here at Gilead.
00:06:34 You can be certain that he hates this school
00:06:37 and all the good that it has accomplished through the years in honoring Jehovah
00:06:41 and benefiting His people and those in the field.
00:06:45 So, then, what temptations or stumbling blocks
00:06:48 might Satan try to place before you
00:06:52 now that you’ve graduated from this school?
00:06:54 Well, here are a few things, and they are things
00:06:57 that all of us must face.
00:07:00 For example,
00:07:02 if you’re not careful, you might be tempted
00:07:04 to become self-satisfied with what you have accomplished.
00:07:08 Don’t ever let that happen to you.
00:07:10 Never be self-satisfied.
00:07:12 Keep setting goals for yourself.
00:07:14 Strive to please Jehovah more and more each day
00:07:18 in all that you do.
00:07:20 It’s the principles that we draw from God’s Word
00:07:23 that help us to do that.
00:07:25 Yet, here’s a caution: Your healthy desire to keep setting goals
00:07:29 must not be allowed to lead you into the next temptation.
00:07:32 And that is this: the temptation to give in to pride.
00:07:37 That can happen.
00:07:39 It can happen to a person when he or she forgets
00:07:43 who has truly helped them to succeed
00:07:47 —and that is Jehovah.
00:07:49 Those who forget about Jehovah may become
00:07:51 ambitious and try to outshine others.
00:07:53 We must never allow that to happen to our heart and mind.
00:07:58 We must never become like that.
00:08:00 In fact, we must fight against pride.
00:08:01 And one key way to do this
00:08:03 is to remember that in all that you do —in all that we do—
00:08:07 it is always about Jehovah.
00:08:11 When we have that focus,
00:08:13 we will succeed in doing things his way, the right way,
00:08:17 no matter what we face in the future.
00:08:20 So we reflect on his blessings.
00:08:22 We see how he’s strengthened us.
00:08:24 We’re confident he will continue to do so, and he will do that for you.
00:08:29 But we never forget that he’s in charge.
00:08:31 It’s always about Jehovah.
00:08:33 And so we do everything out of love for him.
00:08:38 And that, of course, leads into love for others,
00:08:40 because he loves others.
00:08:43 If a person fails to remember how Jehovah has blessed him or her,
00:08:48 that person might become big in their own eyes, like King Saul did.
00:08:52 You’ll recall his example.
00:08:54 Where did that eventually lead Saul?
00:08:56 It led him away from Jehovah’s favor and blessing.
00:08:59 People like Saul fail to maintain faith.
00:09:04 They fail to remain humble.
00:09:07 What about your faith and your humility?
00:09:11 Well, we see those good qualities in you,
00:09:13 and that’s why we confidently state that you’re ready to face the things ahead.
00:09:18 Along with Jehovah’s blessing, your faith will help you to conquer
00:09:22 any temptation that the wicked one, “the Tempter,” may place before you,
00:09:27 and your humility will help you
00:09:29 to remain unbreakable.
00:09:32 You will be able to defeat the Tempter.
00:09:35 Along with resisting temptation,
00:09:38 your Gilead training will also help you
00:09:41 to continue supporting our vital work for Jehovah’s Kingdom,
00:09:44 his people, and for those who will yet listen.
00:09:47 In fact, for all of God’s people,
00:09:50 this is the greater purpose behind any training
00:09:53 that we receive from him, right?
00:09:56 So, then, wherever you serve,
00:09:58 never forget the purpose behind the blessings
00:10:00 that you have experienced in this school.
00:10:03 Trust in Jehovah and in his Son to help you at all times.
00:10:06 Use your Gilead training in the branches and territories where you are going.
00:10:10 Keep in mind that with God’s help, the One who gives you power,
00:10:15 you are ready to face the things ahead.
00:10:18 Well, we will say a little bit more about this at the conclusion of the program.
00:10:22 Now we’re going to enjoy a series of encouraging talks that for all of us
00:10:27 will strengthen our faith, build up our trust in God,
00:10:30 and highlight his wonderful purpose that we support.
00:10:35 So for the first talk,
00:10:38 we have Brother Gerrit Lösch of the Governing Body.
00:10:42 He will speak on the subject “Cultivate Love That Never Fails.”
00:10:49 Do you want to be loved by others?
00:10:53 Naturally, we all want to be loved.
00:10:57 Love is a basic human need.
00:11:00 Babies thrive on it. Teenagers thrive on it.
00:11:03 Marriage mates thrive on it.
00:11:05 Bethelites and Gilead students thrive on it.
00:11:08 It makes us happy to be loved.
00:11:12 What about loving others?
00:11:14 Love is unselfish.
00:11:16 Loving others makes the receivers happy,
00:11:19 but it also makes us as givers happy.
00:11:23 Love is the reason why we exist.
00:11:27 Jehovah created us out of unselfish love
00:11:31 to let us share not only life
00:11:33 but also the privilege to love him.
00:11:36 Jehovah does not need our love since he does not depend on anybody else,
00:11:41 but he appreciates our love.
00:11:44 He loves to be loved by us.
00:11:48 He created us also with the ability
00:11:51 to love others besides him.
00:11:54 We love to do good to others.
00:11:56 We love to love them.
00:11:59 Since when does love exist?
00:12:02 It always existed.
00:12:05 It had no beginning.
00:12:08 Why?
00:12:09 Because “God is love.”
00:12:11 And we know God had no beginning,
00:12:13 so God’s love had no beginning.
00:12:18 There was no time in the past when God existed but love did not.
00:12:23 Jehovah not only has love,
00:12:25 but he is love personified.
00:12:30 Jehovah created us in his image.
00:12:33 This is why we have this superb privilege
00:12:36 to reflect his love.
00:12:39 In the world, books, movies, and songs often deal with love.
00:12:44 But what kind of love?
00:12:46 Usually romantic love—love that often fails.
00:12:51 Genuine love of God and of neighbor
00:12:53 is widely lacking today.
00:12:56 When describing “the last days,”
00:12:59 the prophecy at 2 Timothy 3:2 has come true
00:13:03 that people are often “lovers of themselves.”
00:13:07 Me-ism and egotism is widespread.
00:13:12 One journal carries the title Self.
00:13:16 People think, ‘First me, then nothing,
00:13:19 and then me again, and then perhaps somebody else.’
00:13:24 At 2 Timothy 3:2, Paul also wrote
00:13:28 that people would be “lovers of money.”
00:13:31 In the same prophecy, it says that the majority
00:13:35 would be “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.”
00:13:40 For many, entertainment and sports
00:13:43 have become the dominant aspect of their lives.
00:13:47 Furthermore, 1 John 2:15 indicates
00:13:50 that there is a battle between two loves
00:13:54 —love of Jehovah and love of the world.
00:13:58 The stronger our love for Jehovah is,
00:14:00 the better we will be able to resist the love of the world.
00:14:06 At Matthew 22:37,
00:14:08 Jesus encouraged cultivating love for God
00:14:11 to the fullest extent possible.
00:14:15 “You must love Jehovah your God
00:14:18 “with your whole heart and with your whole soul
00:14:22 and with your whole mind.”
00:14:25 How does love for Jehovah grow?
00:14:28 We must tend to the good soil of our heart
00:14:31 where the seed of Kingdom truth was sown.
00:14:36 How does love between two persons grow?
00:14:39 One way is by communication.
00:14:43 We communicate with Jehovah through prayer.
00:14:46 Jehovah communicates with us
00:14:49 through the Bible and his organization.
00:14:53 If we study the Bible and read it daily
00:14:56 as well as attend the congregation meetings,
00:14:58 our love for him will continue to grow.
00:15:03 Love needs to grow.
00:15:06 It is not a matter of how much we know
00:15:09 but how much we love what we know.
00:15:13 Head knowledge is not enough.
00:15:16 There needs to be heart knowledge.
00:15:20 Growing in love is a process.
00:15:23 A plant grows when it is watered;
00:15:25 love grows if it is watered with the water of truth.
00:15:30 At Philippians 1:9, Paul says:
00:15:35 “And this is what I continue praying,
00:15:37 that your love may abound yet more and more.”
00:15:43 Love grows gradually.
00:15:45 It is not enough to have a little love;
00:15:48 we should abound in love.
00:15:51 Jehovah sets the example.
00:15:53 He expressed his love by providing the ransom.
00:15:58 In Matthew chapter 18,
00:16:00 Jesus compares Jehovah with a king who was willing to forgive a debt
00:16:05 of 60 million denarii,
00:16:08 or 10,000 silver talents.
00:16:11 This certainly impresses his love for us.
00:16:16 Jesus expressed his love by being willing
00:16:18 to die for our sins.
00:16:21 This stirs our love in return.
00:16:23 The more one has been forgiven, the more one will love.
00:16:28 But love is not dependent on having one’s sins forgiven.
00:16:33 Jesus loved Jehovah so much
00:16:36 but had not a single sin that needed to be forgiven.
00:16:41 But he loved Jehovah, and he loved us.
00:16:45 The night before he died, he said at John 14:31:
00:16:50 “I love the Father.”
00:16:53 Do we not (all of us) feel the same?
00:16:57 How can we demonstrate our love of God in return?
00:17:03 We can do so by serving Jehovah with all our heart.
00:17:07 This includes preaching and teaching.
00:17:12 True or false?
00:17:13 The most important reason for preaching and teaching is
00:17:17 love of neighbor.
00:17:19 It sounds good, but it is wrong.
00:17:23 The most important motive for preaching
00:17:25 is, first of all, love for Jehovah.
00:17:28 And the most important objective
00:17:30 is to praise Jehovah.
00:17:34 We want to glorify him and to support the vindication of his sovereignty.
00:17:40 Love of neighbor comes second.
00:17:43 But we also need to show love to our brothers.
00:17:46 In one congregation, several sisters
00:17:48 took daily turns to prepare a hot meal
00:17:51 for a quadriplegic brother.
00:17:55 This shows that our love extends beyond preaching.
00:17:59 It is like with the parable of the Samaritan
00:18:02 who cared for the man who was assaulted and hurt by robbers.
00:18:07 The Samaritan did not preach to the man who fell among the robbers.
00:18:11 He just showed unselfish love to him.
00:18:16 Jesus emphasized that our neighborly love
00:18:18 should include even enemies.
00:18:22 At Matthew 5:44, he said:
00:18:26 “I say to you: Continue to love your enemies
00:18:29 and to pray for those persecuting you.”
00:18:34 Our love will be perfect
00:18:36 if we love even our enemies.
00:18:39 Jehovah gives sunshine and rain
00:18:42 even to wicked opposers.
00:18:44 One publisher went to a hospital to visit an opposing husband.
00:18:49 The man appreciated this kind gesture very much.
00:18:55 Think of what Jesus has endured.
00:18:58 He was hated without cause, persecuted, reviled, and murdered.
00:19:03 Help people to develop their appreciation
00:19:06 for what Jesus did for us.
00:19:10 Show interested ones that because of the ransom,
00:19:13 Jehovah forgives us our sins
00:19:16 and opens the way to everlasting life.
00:19:20 When you talk about the ransom, don’t do it just in a legalistic way
00:19:24 by saying: “See, like on scales,
00:19:27 “on one side was Adam and on the other side was Jesus.
00:19:31 “God’s justice required that by giving his life,
00:19:34 Jesus restored what Adam had lost.”
00:19:38 Rather, make the student meditate
00:19:41 and develop heart appreciation and love for what Jesus did.
00:19:45 Review with a student what Jesus went through prior to his execution.
00:19:50 Help him picture in his mind how Jesus was flogged,
00:19:54 producing quivering ribbons of bleeding flesh.
00:19:59 Help the student sense how Jesus was mocked.
00:20:03 After his tortured beating,
00:20:05 soldiers said to him mockingly:
00:20:08 “Good day, you King of the Jews!”
00:20:12 Also, they spit on him and slapped him in the face.
00:20:18 Remind the student how the soldiers later pounded large nails
00:20:22 into his hands and into his feet.
00:20:25 With the stake swung upright, the pain was excruciating,
00:20:29 for the weight of the body tore all the nail wounds.
00:20:34 Yet, rather than threaten, Jesus prayed for the Roman soldiers:
00:20:38 “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”
00:20:45 Meditating on what Jesus did for us,
00:20:48 does this not greatly deepen our love for him?
00:20:53 At Ephesians 3:19, Paul wrote:
00:20:56 “The love of the Christ . . . surpasses knowledge.”
00:21:01 It is not the love for the Christ but the love that Jesus displayed
00:21:06 that surpasses head knowledge
00:21:08 and strikes a wonderful chord in our figurative heart.
00:21:13 Jesus’ course stimulates a response in us.
00:21:17 As we think about what Christ has done for us,
00:21:20 our love for him deepens.
00:21:22 In fact, 2 Corinthians 5:14 says:
00:21:26 “For the love the Christ has compels us.”
00:21:31 After mentioning gifts of the spirit, such as healing and speaking in tongues,
00:21:35 Paul explained at 1 Corinthians 12:31:
00:21:40 “Yet I will show you a surpassing way.”
00:21:44 What is this “way”?
00:21:46 The way of love.
00:21:50 In what way is it surpassing?
00:21:52 In the sense that the gifts of the spirit,
00:21:55 including prophesying, would be “done away with.”
00:21:59 But love would always be there.
00:22:02 Jehovah is eternal.
00:22:04 His love will never fail, never end,
00:22:08 but will continue forever and ever and ever.
00:22:14 Therefore, Paul wrote: “There remain
00:22:17 “faith, hope, love, these three;
00:22:20 but the greatest of these is love.”
00:22:24 He also wrote: “Love never fails.”
00:22:28 Love “endures all things.”
00:22:31 Many brothers suffered a lot during World War II
00:22:34 and also today in Russia and other countries.
00:22:37 Today, there are a number of governments in the world that suppress the truth.
00:22:42 As we live in the time of the end, this is not surprising to us.
00:22:46 It will get worse as the great tribulation comes closer.
00:22:51 World conditions are also getting worse in many parts of the world,
00:22:55 and COVID has claimed many human victims.
00:22:59 But we Witnesses keep enduring
00:23:02 by pursuing the surpassing way of love
00:23:05 that never fails.
00:23:07 We shall not only live forever
00:23:10 but also love forever and be loved forever.
00:23:23 Well, thank you very much, Brother Lösch,
00:23:25 for reminding us of how great Jehovah’s love is for us
00:23:30 and how we in turn must show
00:23:32 heartfelt, wholehearted love for Jehovah and others.
00:23:36 Our next talk on the program will be given
00:23:39 by Brother Gajus Glockentin, a helper to the Publishing Committee.
00:23:44 And the theme for his talk is “How Often Will You Go to Shiloh?”
00:23:51 They were speechless when they heard
00:23:54 she would leave home and join full-time service.
00:23:58 Instead of pursuing their common goals, dreams, and hopes,
00:24:02 she would do whatever she was told to do.
00:24:05 What a sacrifice!
00:24:07 They were so proud of her.
00:24:10 And they started thinking about what to do in order to support her.
00:24:14 Whom are we talking about?
00:24:17 Let us open to Judges 11,
00:24:21 and let’s find out who they were
00:24:24 and what they did.
00:24:27 Dear soon-to-be graduates, what they did
00:24:31 is something that will help you
00:24:33 to succeed in your assignment.
00:24:36 Let’s read, please, Judges 11:40:
00:24:41 “From year to year,
00:24:43 “the young women of Israel
00:24:46 “would go to give commendation
00:24:49 “to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
00:24:52 four days in the year.”
00:24:55 The young women of Israel
00:24:58 went to the sanctuary in Shiloh in order to give
00:25:01 commendation and praise to the daughter of Jephthah.
00:25:05 Commendation strengthened this full-time servant of Jehovah.
00:25:09 Is this not what you want to do too?
00:25:12 So that’s why we have the question for you,
00:25:16 How often will you “go to Shiloh”?
00:25:20 Will you strengthen others and stabilize the organization
00:25:24 by regularly commending and praising others?
00:25:29 Let us, therefore, ask the following questions:
00:25:32 What type of commendation is effective in strengthening others?
00:25:37 How can you imitate the young women of Israel?
00:25:40 And why do you want to give commendation regularly?
00:25:45 Let’s start with the first question,
00:25:47 What type of commendation is effective in strengthening others?
00:25:51 And let us, please, look at the example that Jesus set
00:25:54 as we turn to Mark chapter 5.
00:25:57 Here he commends
00:25:59 the frightened, sick woman who touched his outer garment.
00:26:04 As we read Mark 5:34,
00:26:08 please watch out for five elements
00:26:11 of effective commendation
00:26:15 —Mark 5:34:
00:26:18 “He said to her:
00:26:22 “‘Daughter, your faith has made you well.
00:26:26 Go in peace, and be healed from your grievous sickness.’”
00:26:31 Did you note what made this commendation effective?
00:26:36 First, effective commendation is specific.
00:26:40 Jesus commended the woman for what she did.
00:26:43 Her faith moved her to act.
00:26:47 Effective commendation is sincere.
00:26:51 The woman’s faith was real
00:26:53 and outstanding.
00:26:56 Did you notice that Jesus did not use the opportunity
00:27:00 to counsel her for violating the Law?
00:27:03 This might have made his commendation sound insincere.
00:27:08 Third, effective commendation is personal.
00:27:11 Jesus used the expression “daughter.”
00:27:15 That expression emphasized his tender concern for her.
00:27:21 Fourth, effective commendation is more than words.
00:27:24 Jesus acknowledged the needs of the woman
00:27:27 and followed up with deeds.
00:27:29 He healed her.
00:27:31 And fifth,
00:27:33 effective commendation is unselfish.
00:27:37 Jesus did not commend the woman in order to make himself look good,
00:27:42 but he was concerned about her
00:27:44 and wanted to make her feel good.
00:27:47 Now, can you do the same?
00:27:49 Let’s go back to Judges 11,
00:27:52 and let’s look again at verse 40.
00:27:54 So this is Judges 11:40, and let’s answer the second question,
00:27:59 How can you imitate the young women of Israel?
00:28:02 So the verse started here in verse 40 by saying
00:28:05 “from year to year,”
00:28:07 so this means regularly,
00:28:12 repeatedly.
00:28:13 The young women would praise the same person
00:28:17 again and again.
00:28:20 In your assignment as you work with others in Bethel, in the ministry,
00:28:24 or watch them in your congregation,
00:28:26 can you repeatedly praise them?
00:28:30 For instance, could you praise them for their zeal,
00:28:33 their fine efforts,
00:28:36 or for their acts of love?
00:28:38 Could you send an upbuilding text message saying
00:28:41 “Great job,” “Well done,” “Thumbs up,” “Loved it,”
00:28:45 maybe along with a brief comment?
00:28:49 These messages do not require a lot of effort and time,
00:28:53 but they can go a long way.
00:28:56 One time is not enough.
00:28:59 Do it again and again.
00:29:00 Don’t worry that the person could get a big head.
00:29:03 In the Bible,
00:29:05 Jehovah praised and commended
00:29:08 the persons whom he loved repeatedly.
00:29:12 Commending others again and again is a good thing.
00:29:18 Now, the verse continues here, saying:
00:29:20 “The young women of Israel would go to give commendation
00:29:23 “to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
00:29:26 four days in the year.”
00:29:30 Being away from their family obligations
00:29:32 must have been a sacrifice.
00:29:35 Somebody else must have taken over their usual work.
00:29:38 They had to travel to Shiloh
00:29:41 and they may also have brought a gift.
00:29:45 Now, could this serve as a reminder
00:29:48 that giving commendation might sometimes require
00:29:52 a little bit more time and effort and can come at a personal cost?
00:29:56 Yes.
00:29:58 Calling somebody or visiting him
00:30:02 requires time and effort.
00:30:05 Spending time with your brother and sister honors them.
00:30:10 Being out with them in the ministry, working together on a project,
00:30:14 or asking them for advice
00:30:18 really makes them feel good and can be a powerful commendation.
00:30:22 It’s worth all it costs.
00:30:27 Timing is important too.
00:30:29 Proverbs 15:23 states:
00:30:32 “A word spoken
00:30:34 at the right time—how good it is!”
00:30:38 So, what is “the right time” for commendation?
00:30:41 The verses leading up to our theme scripture here
00:30:44 mentioned that Jephthah’s daughter
00:30:46 right away got much needed support.
00:30:50 So generally speaking, commendation is of greatest value
00:30:54 when it’s given as soon as the opportunity comes up,
00:30:59 even if it’s initially just a brief comment.
00:31:02 The sooner somebody receives positive feedback,
00:31:06 the quicker feelings of insecurity or doubts will vanish
00:31:10 and the sooner the other person will be happy and feel good.
00:31:14 Please do not wait too long,
00:31:18 but act right away.
00:31:21 Now, this leads us to our third and final question,
00:31:24 Why do you want to give commendation regularly?
00:31:28 As you go to your assignments,
00:31:30 you will be surrounded by many “daughters of Jephthah”
00:31:35 —faithful, full-time servants of Jehovah
00:31:38 who made sacrifices to serve.
00:31:41 This auditorium is full of them, and you are among them.
00:31:47 You will meet
00:31:50 brothers and sisters in the congregation,
00:31:53 and some of them are insecure—worried.
00:31:58 Sometimes they doubt that they are worth anything.
00:32:02 They are giving their very best to stay faithful despite challenges
00:32:06 —fighting with their own imperfection,
00:32:08 dealing with the results of their own mistakes,
00:32:10 and are sometimes discouraged
00:32:13 because of setbacks.
00:32:16 They need commendation.
00:32:20 We all need commendation
00:32:23 because commendation enhances a person’s self-esteem,
00:32:26 it builds confidence and motivates to action,
00:32:29 it reinforces our desire
00:32:32 to do good things,
00:32:34 and it encourages us to keep on doing our very best.
00:32:38 Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.
00:32:43 Now, there’s another important aspect.
00:32:48 The reality is
00:32:50 that when you work closely with brothers and sisters,
00:32:53 you see their flaws and mistakes.
00:32:57 So, what are you going to do?
00:32:59 Will you ignore that person?
00:33:02 Or will you try to imitate Jehovah,
00:33:05 who is searching for the good in us?
00:33:08 Make it a habit to search for the good,
00:33:12 and then give voice to the positive.
00:33:15 Now, what happens to us
00:33:19 if we are doing it that way?
00:33:22 It can change us.
00:33:25 It can change us from being a complainer
00:33:29 to being a commender.
00:33:32 A commender focuses on the good in others.
00:33:36 He sees others
00:33:38 with Jehovah’s eyes.
00:33:43 A commender is very happy because he sees
00:33:46 all the beauty around him.
00:33:50 So if you gain a reputation
00:33:53 for commending rather than complaining,
00:33:56 you will succeed in your assignment
00:33:59 because others will love to work with you.
00:34:02 Dear soon-to-be graduates of the 151st class of Gilead,
00:34:06 please make commending and praising others
00:34:10 part of your personality —something that comes naturally.
00:34:16 So how often will you “go to Shiloh”?
00:34:19 Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.
00:34:27 Well, thank you very much, Brother Glockentin.
00:34:30 That was such a nice follow-up to Brother Lösch’s talk on love.
00:34:35 And you really helped us, all of us brothers and sisters,
00:34:39 to remember the need to encourage
00:34:41 and repeatedly commend others.
00:34:45 Well, this next subject
00:34:47 seems to follow right along too so nicely:
00:34:50 “Does Jehovah Recognize You?”
00:34:52 And it will be delivered by Brother Luther Georges,
00:34:56 a member of the U.S. Branch Committee.
00:34:59 How do you feel when you have exerted yourself in some way
00:35:04 and someone you deeply respect says to you,
00:35:08 “Well done”?
00:35:10 Don’t you feel assured that your efforts
00:35:12 were recognized and appreciated?
00:35:16 However, when you dear brothers and sisters
00:35:19 in the 151st class of Gilead
00:35:21 arrive at your assignments and you exert yourself
00:35:24 to accomplish the work you’ve been given
00:35:26 and give of yourself to encourage and help others,
00:35:29 suppose you don’t always receive
00:35:34 an audible “well done” from others.
00:35:38 How will you feel?
00:35:40 Does that mean that your efforts were not appreciated and recognized?
00:35:45 To answer those questions, we are going to consider:
00:35:47 first, what Jesus had to say on the subject;
00:35:50 second, what we can learn from some Bible examples;
00:35:54 and third, what this means for you personally.
00:35:58 Although the desire to receive recognition from humans is normal,
00:36:02 Jesus helps us to have a balanced view in Matthew chapter 6.
00:36:07 Please turn to Matthew chapter 6, and note verse 3
00:36:11 —Matthew 6:3:
00:36:13 “But you, when making gifts of mercy,
00:36:16 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.”
00:36:21 Now, what did Jesus mean?
00:36:23 Well, these “gifts of mercy” were really donations for needy ones.
00:36:27 But with these words, Jesus was exhorting his disciples
00:36:32 not to imitate
00:36:34 the insincere religious leaders of his day
00:36:37 who publicized their gifts of mercy
00:36:39 just to be recognized by humans.
00:36:42 Now, what would be the result of heeding Jesus words here in verse 3?
00:36:47 Well, Jesus explains in verse 4.
00:36:50 He says: “So that your gifts of mercy may be in secret.”
00:36:55 Now, for a moment, think of the gifts of mercy
00:36:58 —the kindnesses and the theocratic assignments
00:37:01 that you have performed in secret.
00:37:04 For example, likely you’ve many times telephoned or visited
00:37:07 an ailing brother or sister just to reassure them
00:37:10 of your love and your concern,
00:37:13 and you’ve even prayed with them,
00:37:15 or perhaps you spent considerable time
00:37:18 being a spiritual mentor to a Christian youth,
00:37:22 or you may have given generously of yourself
00:37:25 to encourage and provide practical assistance
00:37:28 to a distressed brother or sister
00:37:31 —all of this you did “in secret.”
00:37:34 However, Jesus said that someone that you deeply respect did take note.
00:37:39 Look there at Matthew 6:4.
00:37:44 He stated in the B  part:
00:37:47 “Your Father who looks on in secret.”
00:37:51 The point is that Jehovah, who resides in the heavens,
00:37:54 is invisible to mankind,
00:37:57 so he remains in secret as far as humans are concerned.
00:38:01 But your good deeds
00:38:04 are recognized with approval by Jehovah.
00:38:09 Now, how can we be sure of that?
00:38:12 Well, there are many Bible examples
00:38:14 of faithful men and women, young and old,
00:38:17 whose good deeds and heartfelt devotion
00:38:20 were recognized with approval by Jehovah.
00:38:23 One example is Obadiah, the household steward
00:38:26 of wicked King Ahab.
00:38:28 First Kings chapter 18 explains
00:38:31 that he discreetly, secretly, and cautiously hid
00:38:35 100 of Jehovah’s prophets
00:38:37 so they would not be killed by wicked Jezebel.
00:38:41 Now, as illustrated here, Obadiah supplied them with bread and water
00:38:46 in groups of 50 in caves
00:38:48 without being observed by others.
00:38:51 How do we know that Jehovah in secret recognized with approval
00:38:56 this faithful, generous, compassionate man?
00:39:00 Well, we know because his courageous acts are recorded in the Bible
00:39:05 for generations of people to read about.
00:39:08 Another example is the young, nameless Israelite girl
00:39:13 mentioned in 2 Kings chapter 5.
00:39:16 She was taken away from her God-fearing family by the Syrians.
00:39:21 Now, as can be seen in this picture,
00:39:24 although surrounded by false worshippers,
00:39:28 she courageously told Naaman’s wife
00:39:31 about Jehovah’s prophet Elisha.
00:39:33 That led to Naaman’s miraculous healing of leprosy,
00:39:38 it led to Naaman’s becoming a worshipper of Jehovah,
00:39:42 and it certainly contributed to Jehovah’s praise.
00:39:47 We don’t know the name of that little girl —do we?—
00:39:50 but Jehovah does, who in secret
00:39:53 looked favorably on that young girl.
00:39:56 So these two examples and many others in the Scriptures assure you
00:40:00 that your good deeds are noted by Jehovah.
00:40:07 Please note, though, that Jehovah does more
00:40:11 than just look on in secret.
00:40:14 Look again, please, at Matthew 6:4.
00:40:20 The B  part read in its entirety says:
00:40:24 “Then your Father who looks on in secret
00:40:27 will repay you.”
00:40:29 Often, Jehovah repays us in unexpected ways
00:40:33 —in ways that are better and more meaningful
00:40:36 than humans could ever give us
00:40:39 in the way of recognition.
00:40:42 But how does Jehovah repay us?
00:40:45 While there are many ways,
00:40:48 we’re going to focus just on three significant ones.
00:40:51 One way is mentioned at Matthew 5:7
00:40:55 —Matthew 5:7.
00:40:57 Jesus said: “Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.”
00:41:02 So by our being kind and merciful,
00:41:04 Jehovah mercifully forgives us and allows us to enjoy
00:41:09 a warm, personal relationship with him.
00:41:13 A second way he repays us is mentioned
00:41:16 at Mark 10:29, 30.
00:41:20 There Jesus promised that we would receive “100 times more”
00:41:24 than anything we sacrifice to serve Jehovah.
00:41:27 And one resulting, tangible reward that Jehovah provides
00:41:32 is our ever-expanding, loving spiritual family.
00:41:36 A third way he repays us is by means of his promise
00:41:39 of the priceless reward of everlasting life in God’s new world.
00:41:44 And regarding righteous ones
00:41:47 who perform good deeds but fall asleep in death
00:41:50 before the end of this system,
00:41:52 Jesus at Luke 14:14 gave the assurance
00:41:56 that they will be repaid in the resurrection.
00:41:59 And then they will see the full effect
00:42:02 of Jehovah’s recognition and blessing
00:42:05 on their good deeds.
00:42:09 In addition to your gifts of mercy
00:42:13 in your new assignments,
00:42:15 your heartfelt devotion will be reflected
00:42:19 as you, with Jehovah’s help,
00:42:23 face and successfully endure various challenges
00:42:27 —many of which others will know nothing about.
00:42:31 But even though you may not receive recognition
00:42:35 or a complimentary “well done” from others
00:42:38 for your good deeds, your kindnesses,
00:42:41 your sacrifices, and your endurance,
00:42:44 please remain confident
00:42:46 that you will be recognized with approval
00:42:49 by a loving Father, Jehovah.
00:42:52 And as Jesus promised:
00:42:54 “[Jehovah] who looks on in secret
00:42:57 will repay you.”
00:43:09 Thank you very much, Brother Georges, for highlighting
00:43:12 that no matter what happens around us,
00:43:14 Jehovah sees and treasures the good that we try so hard to do.
00:43:20 Next, we have here Brother Richard Chilton,
00:43:23 one of the Gilead School instructors,
00:43:25 and he will speak on the subject “‘Who Will Rise Up for Me?’”
00:43:35 I’d like to start by telling you an experience
00:43:38 of a brother at Patterson Bethel.
00:43:41 He had recently lost a loved one
00:43:44 —a parent, in fact—
00:43:46 in a horrible accident.
00:43:49 And he desperately needed to talk with someone
00:43:52 about what he was going through and how he was feeling.
00:43:56 He was, in a word, unraveling, and he needed help.
00:44:02 So he called a close friend of his at Wallkill Bethel
00:44:07 but, unfortunately, the brother said that at that time
00:44:11 he was unable to talk.
00:44:14 Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation
00:44:19 —that is, feeling like you’re drowning
00:44:22 and in need of assistance?
00:44:24 The psalmist did.
00:44:27 Please read with me his words in the 94th Psalm
00:44:31 and note his question.
00:44:34 It’s Psalm 94:16.
00:44:39 The psalmist asked in part:
00:44:42 “Who will rise up for me?”
00:44:48 “Who will rise up for me?”
00:44:53 He goes on to answer his own question
00:44:56 in verses 17 and 19.
00:44:59 He says: “If Jehovah had not been my helper,
00:45:02 “I would soon have perished. . . .
00:45:06 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
00:45:08 you [Jehovah, you] comforted and soothed me.”
00:45:14 Well, when you and I send up such heartfelt prayers to Jehovah,
00:45:18 how does he rise up for us?
00:45:21 And how can we imitate him
00:45:25 by rising up in behalf of others?
00:45:29 Let’s go back in time and consider an example.
00:45:33 During the days of Israel’s judges,
00:45:37 there lived a wealthy landowner named Boaz.
00:45:42 In obedience to Jehovah’s Law,
00:45:44 he made sure that in his fields
00:45:47 gleanings were left for the afflicted and poor.
00:45:52 One day,
00:45:54 he observes a woman working in his fields
00:45:58 that he does not recognize.
00:46:00 And soon he learns that she is the foreigner Ruth,
00:46:05 who up to this point, he has only heard about.
00:46:09 Well, what does Boaz do?
00:46:11 Notice how he rose up for her
00:46:15 at Ruth 2:8
00:46:18 —Ruth chapter 2,
00:46:21 starting with verse 8:
00:46:23 “Boaz said to Ruth: ‘Listen, my daughter.
00:46:27 “‘Do not go away to glean in another field,
00:46:31 “‘and do not go anywhere else;
00:46:33 “‘stay close by my young women.
00:46:36 “‘Keep your eyes on the field that they harvest,
00:46:40 “‘and go with them.
00:46:42 “‘I have commanded the young men not to touch you.
00:46:46 “‘When you are thirsty,
00:46:48 go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn.’”
00:46:53 Clearly, Boaz protected Ruth.
00:46:57 He brought her under his loving care.
00:47:01 We see him looking out for, shielding,
00:47:04 defending the one in need.
00:47:08 And when Ruth, according to verse 10,
00:47:11 questions his motive for helping her, a foreigner,
00:47:16 notice a second way he rose up in her behalf
00:47:20 at Ruth 2:11:
00:47:23 “Boaz answered her:
00:47:25 “‘A full report was made to me
00:47:28 “‘of all you have done for your mother-in-law
00:47:32 “‘after the death of your husband
00:47:34 “‘and how you left your father and your mother
00:47:39 “‘and the land of your relatives
00:47:41 “‘to go to a people whom you had not known before.
00:47:45 “‘May Jehovah reward you for what you have done,
00:47:50 “‘and may there be a perfect wage for you
00:47:53 “‘from Jehovah the God of Israel,
00:47:57 “under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.’
00:48:01 “To this she said:
00:48:03 “‘Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord,
00:48:07 “‘because you have comforted me
00:48:11 “‘and spoken reassuringly
00:48:15 “‘to your servant,
00:48:17 although I’m not even one of your servants.’”
00:48:21 When Boaz spoke reassuringly to Ruth,
00:48:25 the footnote says that he ‘spoke to her heart.’
00:48:30 How so?
00:48:32 His words were not just general expressions of praise.
00:48:36 They were specific to Ruth
00:48:39 and to her personal circumstances.
00:48:42 He reassured Ruth that Jehovah loved her
00:48:46 for all the sacrifices she had made
00:48:49 and that she would not be forgotten.
00:48:52 Those comforting, encouraging words of Boaz
00:48:55 convinced Ruth
00:48:57 that everything was going to be OK.
00:49:01 But Boaz did more than offer reassuring words.
00:49:06 Notice the third way he rose up
00:49:09 at Ruth 4:9.
00:49:12 By taking swift action,
00:49:15 Boaz ensured that the inheritance
00:49:19 of his deceased relative Elimelech
00:49:21 would remain in their family
00:49:24 —chapter 4, verse 9:
00:49:27 “Boaz said to the elders and all the people:
00:49:31 “‘You are witnesses today
00:49:33 “‘that I am buying from Naomi
00:49:37 “‘all that belonged to Elimelech
00:49:42 “‘and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.
00:49:46 “‘I am also acquiring Ruth the Moabitess,
00:49:49 “‘the wife of Mahlon, as a wife [for what reason?]
00:49:54 “‘to restore the name of the dead man
00:49:57 “‘to his inheritance,
00:49:59 “‘so that the name of the dead man
00:50:02 “‘will not be cut off from among his brothers
00:50:05 “‘and from the city gate of his home.
00:50:07 You are witnesses today.’”
00:50:12 Jehovah used Boaz
00:50:15 to rise up for Ruth and Naomi
00:50:18 in three main ways.
00:50:20 One,
00:50:22 he protected those under his care.
00:50:26 Second,
00:50:28 he spoke reassuringly to them.
00:50:31 And third,
00:50:33 he took action.
00:50:36 Seeing the need, he rose up to meet it
00:50:40 —he protected,
00:50:42 he reassured,
00:50:44 he took action.
00:50:48 Well, how about you and me?
00:50:52 Should we not do the same
00:50:54 for those in need of assistance?
00:50:58 And what can result when we do?
00:51:02 Well, before you answer that,
00:51:04 let’s go back to our opening experience.
00:51:09 You see, the very next morning
00:51:12 upon arriving at his work assignment,
00:51:16 our distressed brother received a phone call
00:51:19 from the Patterson lobby.
00:51:22 It was the brother, the friend from Wallkill.
00:51:27 He had gotten up early that morning
00:51:30 and had driven over an hour from the Wallkill complex
00:51:34 to reach the Patterson complex by 8:00 a.m.
00:51:38 He had arranged for a private conference room,
00:51:42 and he was there waiting for that distressed friend
00:51:47 so that he could find out, “How can I help?”
00:51:51 That was 22 years ago.
00:51:54 But I can tell you now,
00:51:56 I have never forgotten
00:51:59 what that friend did for me
00:52:01 when he rose up for me on that day.
00:52:05 By means of the action that he took,
00:52:08 I felt reassured,
00:52:10 I felt protected, and I felt loved.
00:52:14 So the question
00:52:17 for you 24 students—
00:52:21 In fact, the question for all of us
00:52:23 in our hearing audience is this:
00:52:26 What will you do
00:52:28 to rise up for someone in need?
00:52:32 We have every confidence
00:52:34 that each and every one of you
00:52:37 will answer that call when it comes,
00:52:40 saying: “Here I am.
00:52:42 I will rise up for you. How can I help?”
00:52:52 Thank you so much, Brother Chilton.
00:52:54 We appreciated that reassurance that when we rise up to help others,
00:52:59 Jehovah will love us for it
00:53:01 and others will rise up in turn for us.
00:53:05 Next, we have another instructor from the Gilead School,
00:53:09 Brother Trent Lippold.
00:53:11 And his theme is a question: “Will I Be More?”
00:53:19 The apostle Paul was not a man given to boasting.
00:53:22 But on one occasion,
00:53:24 he felt compelled to boast a little.
00:53:28 And that account is found for us in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 11.
00:53:32 Please read with me 2 Corinthians 11:23:
00:53:40 “Are they ministers of Christ?
00:53:44 “I reply like a madman,
00:53:46 I am more outstandingly one.”
00:53:51 What was the subject of Paul’s boast?
00:53:55 Being a minister of Christ.
00:53:58 And now, being a minister of Christ, what was Paul’s focus in this boast?
00:54:03 He said:
00:54:05 “I am more outstandingly one.”
00:54:09 William Tyndale, when he translated this verse,
00:54:12 kept the very terseness and the clarity of the Greek
00:54:16 when he simply said: “I am more.”
00:54:19 That’s Paul’s boast.
00:54:23 What is he focusing on, though, as a minister of Christ in his boast?
00:54:28 He said: “I have done more work.”
00:54:32 And now from verses 23 through 27,
00:54:34 he gives almost a résumé
00:54:37 of what happened to him because of the work
00:54:41 he did as a minister of Christ.
00:54:45 Well, how will your properly focusing on your work
00:54:50 as a minister of Christ help you to succeed in your assignments?
00:54:56 Let’s consider an example.
00:54:58 And it’s found in the book of Luke chapter 8
00:55:03 —Luke 8:1-3:
00:55:11 “Shortly afterward he [this is Christ]
00:55:14 “traveled from city to city and from village to village,
00:55:18 “preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God.
00:55:22 “And the Twelve were with him, as were certain women
00:55:25 “who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses:
00:55:29 “Mary who was called Magdalene,
00:55:32 “from whom seven demons had come out;
00:55:35 “Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s man in charge;
00:55:40 “Susanna; and many other women,
00:55:44 who were ministering to them from their belongings.”
00:55:49 A group: Christ, the Twelve,
00:55:54 and women
00:55:56 (women who ministered to the others)
00:56:00 —what did that mean?
00:56:02 Did it mean they cooked the meals, washed the dishes, mended the clothes?
00:56:06 Possibly but not necessarily entirely that.
00:56:11 These women ministered to the others
00:56:14 by helping them to complete their assignment
00:56:18 as they went on completing their assignment as disciples of Christ.
00:56:24 Notice the backgrounds of these women.
00:56:27 Luke mentions three.
00:56:29 He says they’re women who were cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses.
00:56:33 Look at Mary.
00:56:34 “Mary,” he says, “from whom seven demons had come out.”
00:56:39 He also mentions “Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s man in charge,”
00:56:44 and “Susanna.”
00:56:46 Think of their backgrounds.
00:56:48 Mary—seven demons came out of her.
00:56:50 I wonder how that demon possession contributed to her personality.
00:56:54 What about Joanna?
00:56:57 “Joanna,” it says “the wife of Chuza, Herod’s man in charge.”
00:57:02 In other words, Joanna lived in Herod’s palace;
00:57:06 she was a woman of the court.
00:57:09 And also Susanna
00:57:11 —it doesn’t say specifically much about her
00:57:14 other than perhaps she was one of the women who was cured of a sickness.
00:57:18 What was her personality like?
00:57:21 How did these personalities work together?
00:57:26 Here’s part of the example of what can help us to minister,
00:57:31 and that is to realize that when we look through the Gospel accounts,
00:57:35 we never find these women bickering or arguing among themselves
00:57:40 about position or prominence or place,
00:57:43 unlike some others in the group that were with them.
00:57:48 Why?
00:57:50 Because these women focused on their ministry;
00:57:54 they focused on their work.
00:57:56 They served others, and they served each other.
00:58:00 And that is a powerful example for you and for me.
00:58:05 Remember at Isaiah 11:6, it’s prophesied:
00:58:10 “The wolf will reside . . . with the lamb.”
00:58:13 Lions with calves —it’s not going to be all lambs.
00:58:19 You will meet diverse personalities in your assignments,
00:58:23 and you will have to work with diverse personalities
00:58:27 just like the women did.
00:58:29 So, what will you do?
00:58:31 Remember that some of the very qualities that make a lion or make a wolf
00:58:36 might be exactly the qualities you need
00:58:40 to help you fulfill your assignment.
00:58:43 So they’re not all lambs, but they are all our brothers and sisters.
00:58:49 So if Jehovah allows a diversity of personalities
00:58:53 within the context of the new personality, then so should we.
00:58:57 Diverse personalities make for rich friendships.
00:59:03 You know, Luke wrote these words,
00:59:05 and he’s talking about events
00:59:07 that took place around the Passover of 31 C.E.
00:59:10 When you think of these women,
00:59:11 these women were with Jesus
00:59:16 at Golgotha.
00:59:18 These women were at the tomb.
00:59:21 Likely these women may have been in the upper room as well.
00:59:25 That tells us that these women endured
00:59:28 challenging circumstances.
00:59:30 They stuck with the Lord.
00:59:32 What helped them?
00:59:35 Look back at the verse.
00:59:37 Verse 2 says:
00:59:38 “As were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses.”
00:59:45 These women deeply appreciated what Jesus had done for them.
00:59:50 Certainly they glorified God because of what Jesus had done for them.
00:59:54 But they also
00:59:56 allowed their appreciation to help them endure
01:00:01 —to endure in a self-sacrificing life of ministering to others.
01:00:06 So stay appreciative, and that will help you endure.
01:00:12 Our friends are dying; our friends are getting sick.
01:00:19 Meditate on how Jehovah has blessed you.
01:00:23 Meditate on the little things each day,
01:00:27 the little gifts Jehovah gives you
01:00:30 —maybe it’s simply the peace in your heart and mind this day.
01:00:35 Remain appreciative for that,
01:00:37 and that will help you endure as a minister in your assignment.
01:00:43 One other thing that’s noteworthy about these women
01:00:45 is that these women were not easily thrown off by others.
01:00:50 Remember we said— We talked about others, the other disciples.
01:00:53 When other disciples left Christ, the women stayed.
01:00:58 At Golgotha, even the apostles
01:01:02 to a certain degree had left Christ or fled.
01:01:05 The women stayed.
01:01:08 They stood solidly on their own faith.
01:01:12 Brothers and sisters, do not be thrown off easily by others.
01:01:16 Sometimes—and you can imagine for these women with the disciples—
01:01:19 it felt like a family.
01:01:22 And sometimes today in families ones choose to leave Jehovah
01:01:26 even at this late hour.
01:01:28 Stand solidly on your own faith.
01:01:32 Like the women, do not be easily thrown off.
01:01:35 Stay with Jehovah.
01:01:38 These women must have made quite an impression on Luke,
01:01:40 because he’s the only Gospel writer who mentions them by name in this way.
01:01:47 And interestingly, Luke was a traveling companion of Paul’s.
01:01:49 From about 50 C.E. in Troas,
01:01:51 he picked up with Paul and started traveling with him,
01:01:53 and he traveled with him for years.
01:01:56 I wonder if they spoke together.
01:01:58 I wonder if they spoke about these women.
01:02:01 I wonder if they talked about how important it is
01:02:04 to focus on the work of ministering
01:02:07 and not to get distracted by other things.
01:02:11 Or I wonder if they talked about the value of preserving unity
01:02:16 by learning to work with different personalities.
01:02:20 Did they talk about the power of appreciation to endure?
01:02:25 We don’t know.
01:02:26 But what we do know is this: When Paul was in prison in Rome,
01:02:30 and he wrote his letter to the Hebrews,
01:02:32 the congregation in Judea in Jerusalem, Luke was with him.
01:02:37 And do you remember what Paul wrote at Hebrews 6:10?
01:02:39 He said: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love
01:02:43 you showed for his name by ministering.”
01:02:49 Jehovah did not forget these women.
01:02:52 And Jehovah will not forget you.
01:02:56 May you work hard
01:02:58 to put into practice the things that you have learned.
01:03:02 And may you be able to say
01:03:04 that you are more outstandingly a minister of Christ.
01:03:16 Well, thank you very much, Brother Lippold, for those Scriptural examples.
01:03:19 We are more determined to focus on our work
01:03:22 as ministers of the Christ.
01:03:26 What a delightful program!
01:03:28 And that was only the first part.
01:03:31 Later this month, Parts 2 and 3
01:03:35 will be available on jw.org,
01:03:39 so be sure to tune in.
01:03:43 In this month’s video postcard,
01:03:46 we are visiting the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe.
01:03:51 On a world map,
01:03:52 they look like tiny spots
01:03:55 located in the Gulf of Guinea
01:03:57 off the western coast of Africa.
01:04:00 The rainy, humid climate
01:04:02 in São Tomé and Príncipe produces
01:04:05 luxurious rain forests,
01:04:08 covering the slopes of mountains that can rise
01:04:11 to over 2,000 meters,
01:04:13 or 6,600 feet.
01:04:17 These tropical islands are surrounded by palm-fringed beaches.
01:04:22 The residents are often gifted
01:04:25 with amazing sunsets.
01:04:29 The people of São Tomé and Príncipe
01:04:32 are hardworking
01:04:34 —often washing their clothes in the Abade River.
01:04:39 Many have work related to palm trees,
01:04:43 which includes palm oil,
01:04:47 palm wine,
01:04:49 and handicraft production.
01:04:52 And we can see that it is hard work!
01:04:56 Their delicious cuisine
01:04:58 is based on a wide variety of fruits,
01:05:02 such as guava, passion fruit, papaya, mango,
01:05:06 as well as seafood dishes.
01:05:08 But there is another work
01:05:11 taking place on São Tomé and Príncipe.
01:05:15 These friendly and warmhearted people
01:05:19 have a deep appreciation for God’s Word,
01:05:23 and it is customary
01:05:25 to see them reading the Bible on their balconies.
01:05:30 During the pandemic,
01:05:32 the brothers and sisters adapted their preaching work
01:05:35 by writing letters and delivering them
01:05:39 as conditions permitted.
01:05:42 The 933 publishers
01:05:45 in the 14 congregations
01:05:48 are conducting 1,705 Bible studies,
01:05:53 and baptisms continued throughout the pandemic.
01:05:58 Because of the high cost of Internet access,
01:06:02 some of our brothers and sisters along with other interested ones
01:06:07 can attend the meetings,
01:06:09 the Memorial,
01:06:11 and conventions
01:06:13 by means of the only local TV channel.
01:06:19 Thanks to this arrangement,
01:06:21 many Bible studies are requested every week.
01:06:25 What was the Memorial attendance in 2021?
01:06:29 The attendance was 5,794,
01:06:34 which is more than six times the number of publishers!
01:06:38 Here are some
01:06:40 of your fellow brothers and sisters
01:06:42 from the São Marçal Congregation.
01:06:45 The 131 publishers there conduct
01:06:48 190 Bible studies.
01:06:52 The happy and loyal brothers and sisters
01:06:55 from São Marçal
01:06:56 and all from São Tomé and Príncipe
01:06:59 send their love and greetings.
01:07:02 And we send our love back to all of them!
01:07:08 Thank you for joining us this month.
01:07:11 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:07:15 this is JW Broadcasting!
